## How Does Digital Finance Work?

### Example 1: Mobile Payments & Digital Wallets

A user links their bank account to a [mobile wallet](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/digital-wallet/) like Apple Pay or Google Pay. When making a purchase, Near Field Communication (NFC) technology allows them to pay by simply tapping their phone, with funds deducted instantly from their account.

### Example 2: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending

A fintech platform connects borrowers directly to lenders. Borrowers submit applications online, undergo AI-driven credit assessments, and receive funding from individual investors without traditional bank intermediaries, making loans more accessible and often cheaper.

## Analogy

Think of digital finance like an online shopping mall. Instead of visiting physical bank branches, customers access all financial services—payments, loans, investments—through apps, just as they shop for products on Amazon without stepping into a store.

## ELI5 (Explain Like I’m 5)
