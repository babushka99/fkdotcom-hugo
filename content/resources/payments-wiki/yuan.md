### Definition and Origin

The Yuan (Â¥), officially known as the [Renminbi (RMB)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/r/renminbi/), is the official currency of the People's Republic of China. The term "Renminbi" translates to "the people's currency." The People's Bank of China (PBOC) issues it. The Yuan was introduced in December 1948 with the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It has undergone various reforms over the decades to facilitate its use in international trade and to reflect China's economic policies and objectives.

### Usage Context and Evolution

Historically used within China for all types of economic transactions, the Yuan's role has significantly expanded. With China's economic rise, the RMB is increasingly used in international trade, finance, and as a reserve [currency](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/currency/). The inclusion of the Yuan in the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket in 2016 marked a milestone in its internationalization, reflecting its growing importance in the global financial system.

### Importance and Impact

The Yuan plays a critical role in the global financial sector, influencing global trade balances, investment flows, and economic stability. Its use in [cross-border transactions](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cross-border-money-transfer/) has been facilitated by initiatives like the RMB internationalization and the Belt and Road Initiative, enhancing China's economic influence.

### Key Stakeholders and Users

### Application and Implementation

The Yuan is implemented in global trade through RMB-denominated contracts, bonds, and as a currency for settling international transactions.
