## Brief Definition and Origin

A **pyramid scheme** is a type of **[fraudulent](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/fraudster/) business model** that recruits participants with the promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying real investments or selling genuine products. The structure resembles a pyramid—**early participants profit from recruiting new members**, while later participants lose money when the scheme inevitably collapses.

The term gained prominence in the 20th century as financial scams began adopting tiered, referral-based recruitment models. While some pyramid schemes disguise themselves as legitimate **multi-level marketing (MLM)** businesses, the core fraud lies in **compensation based primarily on recruitment**, not actual product sales.

## Current Usage and Importance

Pyramid schemes are banned in most countries but continue to exist in both **offline and online forms**, often disguised as:

- “Gifting circles”

- “Crypto or token-based investment clubs”

- “Training or mentorship programs”

- “[E-commerce](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/e/e-commerce/) resellers” with mandatory buying and recruitment

The **hallmark of a pyramid scheme** is that money flows **upward**, with no sustainable source of revenue other than **new member contributions**. Products, if present at all, are often **low-value, overpriced, or irrelevant**—serving only as a cover to appear legal.

## Stakeholders and Implementation of Pyramid Scheme

**Key stakeholders:**

- **Scheme promoters**: Create the structure and benefit most from early recruitment.

- **Early participants**: May make money if they aggressively recruit others.

- **Late participants**: Often lose money as the scheme saturates and collapses.

- **Unwitting promoters**: Recruited individuals who unknowingly spread the scheme.

- **Regulators**: Work to identify, warn, and dismantle such schemes.

**How pyramid schemes operate:**

- **Recruitment pitch**: New members are promised high returns or passive income for a small upfront fee or “investment.”

- **Tiered payout**: Money is distributed to higher-level members from the fees paid by new recruits.

- **Pressure to recruit**: Participants are incentivized or required to recruit others to earn commissions.

- **Collapse**: As recruitment slows, the scheme fails to sustain itself, leaving the majority with losses.

## Advantages vs. Disadvantages of Pyramid Scheme

| **Aspect** | **Advantages (for Promoters)** | **Disadvantages (for Participants/Society)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rapid Profit | Early members earn quickly with minimal effort | Most participants lose money |
| Viral Growth | Fast expansion through social circles | Strains relationships, especially with friends/family |
| Illusion of Legitimacy | May appear like a business or training model | Difficult to distinguish from legal MLMs |
| Low Setup Cost | Minimal investment to start a scam | Exploits trust, especially in tight-knit communities |

## Future Outlook

Pyramid schemes continue to evolve, often **blending with modern technology** and cryptocurrency to appear innovative or decentralized. Current trends include:

- **Token-based recruitment programs**

- **"Community gifting" on [blockchain](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/blockchain/) platforms**

- **Apps or platforms with fake e-commerce models**

- **Mentorship schemes charging entry fees**

Authorities worldwide are cracking down with:

- **Stricter laws and clearer MLM regulations**

- **Public advisories and consumer education**

- **Cross-border investigations and asset seizures**

However, **psychological tactics like exclusivity, urgency, and peer pressure** ensure that pyramid schemes remain a persistent global threat.
