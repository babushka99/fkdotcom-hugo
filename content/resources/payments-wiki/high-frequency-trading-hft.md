## Brief Definition and Origin of High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

**High-Frequency Trading (HFT)** is a form of [**algorithmic trading** ](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/algorithmic-trading/)that involves executing a large number of trades **at extremely high speeds**—often within microseconds or nanoseconds—using sophisticated computer algorithms and powerful hardware systems. The goal is to **capitalize on tiny price inefficiencies** across markets, which are often unnoticeable to traditional traders.

HFT emerged in the **early 2000s** as financial markets transitioned from human-driven trading floors to **electronic trading platforms**. The race for speed intensified with advances in fiber optics, microwave transmission, and co-location services offered by exchanges, making HFT one of the most **dominant and controversial forces in modern finance**.
