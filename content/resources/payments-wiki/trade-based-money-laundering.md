## Executive Summary of Trade-Based Money Laundering

- Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) is a method used to disguise illicit financial flows through international trade transactions.

- It involves over- or under-invoicing, multiple invoicing, misrepresentation of goods, and phantom shipments.

- TBML poses significant risks to global financial systems by facilitating crime and corruption.

- Regulators and financial institutions are implementing advanced monitoring techniques to detect and prevent TBML.

- Emerging technologies like blockchain and AI-driven analytics are enhancing anti-money laundering (AML) efforts.

## Definition of Trade-Based Money Laundering

Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) refers to the process of moving illicit funds through trade transactions to obscure their origin and [integrate them into the legitimate economy](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/m/money-laundering/). It exploits international trade systems by manipulating invoices, goods valuation, and shipping documentation.

## Background of Trade-Based Money Laundering

TBML has been an evolving [financial crime](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/financial-crimes/) strategy for decades. As regulatory measures tighten on traditional money laundering methods, criminals have turned to international trade as a means of disguising financial movements. The complexity and volume of global trade provide ample opportunities for illicit activities to go undetected.

## How It Is Used in the Industry Today

Today, TBML is widely used by:

- **Drug cartels and organized crime syndicates** to move and launder proceeds across borders.

- **Terrorist organizations** to finance operations covertly.

- **Corrupt businesses** to evade [taxes](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/t/taxes/) and move illicit wealth.

- **Sanctioned entities** to circumvent financial restrictions.

## How Trade-Based Money Laundering Works (With Examples)

### Example 1: Over- and Under-Invoicing

A company exports goods valued at $1 million but invoices the buyer for only $500,000. The buyer then sends an additional $500,000 from illicit sources, appearing as a legal payment.

### Example 2: Phantom Shipments

A criminal organization creates fake shipping documents for a trade that never happens, allowing illicit funds to be transferred under the guise of legitimate business transactions.

## Analogy of Trade-Based Money Laundering

Think of TBML like sneaking extra luggage past airport security by mislabeling the baggage tag. If a passenger declares a suitcase as light but fills it with heavy valuables, the airline (financial system) is tricked into believing the luggage is different from what it actually is.

## ELI5

Imagine you sell a toy to a friend, but instead of charging $10, you ask for $100 and then return the extra money later in a different way. This trick is how criminals use trade to move money without getting caught.

## Stakeholders and Implementation

### Who Uses It?

- **Criminal networks** for money laundering.

- **Legitimate businesses** that unknowingly facilitate illicit transactions.

- **Governments and regulators** combating financial crime.

- **Financial institutions** monitoring trade finance for suspicious activities.

### Challenges

- High volume and complexity of international trade.

- Difficulty in verifying transaction legitimacy across jurisdictions.

- Limited collaboration between customs and financial institutions.

## Pros & Cons of Trade-Based Money Laundering

### Pros

- Advanced analytics and AI can enhance TBML detection.

- Improved international collaboration can mitigate risks.
