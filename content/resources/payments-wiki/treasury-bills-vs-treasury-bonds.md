Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds) are both debt securities issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to fund the government's spending activities. However, they differ in several key aspects, including their maturity periods, interest payment methods, and investment purposes. Here's a breakdown of the main differences:

### 1. Maturity Period:

- **Treasury Bills:** [Short-term securities](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/t/treasury-bills/) that typically mature in one year or less. Common maturities for T-Bills are 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks.

- **Treasury Bonds:** [Long-term securities](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/t/treasury-bonds/) with the longest maturity of all government securities, typically 20 to 30 years.

### 2. Interest Payment:

- **Treasury Bills:** Sold at a discount to their face value and do not pay periodic interest. The profit for the investor is the difference between the purchase price and the amount they receive at maturity (the face value).

- **Treasury Bonds:** Pay semi-annual interest payments to the holder until maturity. The interest rate is fixed and determined at the initial issuance.

### 3. Investment Purpose:

- **Treasury Bills:** Often used by investors looking for a short-term investment or a safe place to park cash with virtually no default risk.

- **Treasury Bonds:** Suited for long-term investors seeking a steady stream of income through interest payments over many years.

### 4. Yield and Price Volatility:

- **Treasury Bills:** Generally, have lower yields compared to longer-term securities, reflecting their shorter maturities and lower risk. They also have less [price volatility](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/s/selling-volatility/).

- **Treasury Bonds:** Typically offer higher yields to compensate for the increased risk associated with their longer maturity period. They are more sensitive to interest rate changes, which can cause more significant price fluctuations.

### 5. Use in Monetary Policy:

- **Treasury Bills:** Often used in open market operations by the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/) to help control short-term interest rates.

- **Treasury Bonds:** Less commonly used in the day-to-day management of monetary policy but still play a role in the overall economic and fiscal policy framework.

In summary, while both T-Bills and T-Bonds are secure, government-backed investments, they serve different purposes for investors based on their differing structures, maturities, and interest payment mechanisms. Investors choose between them based on their investment horizon, need for regular income, and sensitivity to interest rate changes.
