## Brief Definition and Origin of Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI)

Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) refers to the institutions, systems, and rules that enable the clearing, settlement, and recording of financial transactions. FMIs are critical for the [stability](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/financial-stability/), efficiency, and resilience of financial markets, ensuring that payments, securities, and derivatives transactions are executed safely and reliably.

The concept of FMI emerged in global regulatory discussions after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, when the systemic importance of post-trade and payment systems became evident. The term was formally defined by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) in the 2012 Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI).

## Explain Like I’m 5 (ELI5)

Imagine you and your friends trade cards. One friend keeps the list of who gave what to whom. Another friend makes sure everyone pays what they owe. These friends are like financial market infrastructures—they keep track of trades, make sure payments happen, and ensure no one cheats.

## Types of Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI)

| ****FMI Type**** | ****Function**** |
| **Payment Systems** | Transfer money between institutions (e.g., RTGS systems like [Fedwire](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/fedwire/)) |
| **Central Counterparties (CCPs)** | Become the middleman in a trade, reducing counterparty risk |
| **Central Securities Depositories (CSDs)** | Hold and record ownership of securities (e.g., stocks, bonds) |
| **Securities Settlement Systems (SSSs)** | Ensure the delivery of securities against payment |
| **Trade Repositories (TRs)** | Collect and store data on derivative transactions |

## Core Functions of FMIs

- **Clearing**: Determining obligations between counterparties after a trade is executed

- **Settlement**: Actual transfer of cash or securities to fulfill those obligations

- **Risk Management**: Protecting against counterparty default, operational errors, and cyber threats

- **Record-Keeping**: Maintaining accurate, immutable records of transactions

- **Transparency**: Providing data to regulators and market participants for oversight and analysis

## Examples of Major Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) by Region

| ****FMI Name**** | ****Type**** | ****Country/Region**** | ****Function**** |
| **Fedwire** | Payment System | United States | Real-time gross settlement (RTGS) for USD |
| **CHIPS** | Payment System | United States | Large-value USD payments |
| **TARGET2** | Payment System | Eurozone | Euro RTGS operated by the Eurosystem |
| **DTCC** | CCP & CSD | United States | Central clearing and securities depository |
| **CLS Bank** | Payment System | Global | FX settlement system reducing settlement risk |
| **LCH** | CCP | UK/Europe | Clearing derivatives (rates, FX, swaps) |
| **Euroclear/Clearstream** | CSD & SSS | Europe | Securities settlement and custody |
| **NSCC** | CCP | United States | Clearing U.S. equity trades |
| **CDSC & CDS** | CSD & CCP | Kenya & Canada (respectively) | Local securities depositories and clearing |

## Importance of FMIs

FMIs are **systemically important** because they:

- **Enable market functioning**: Without clearing and settlement, markets cannot operate

- **Reduce counterparty risk**: CCPs protect against defaults that could ripple across the market

- **Improve efficiency**: FMIs streamline transactions, reducing cost and friction

- **Ensure trust**: Participants know trades will be honored and recorded properly

- **Support financial stability**: Prevent payment gridlocks and liquidity freezes during crises

## Risks Associated with FMIs

While FMIs reduce many risks, they can also **concentrate systemic risk** due to their central role.

| ****Risk Type**** | ****Description**** |
| **Operational Risk** | System outages, cyberattacks, or human errors disrupting services |
| **Liquidity Risk** | One participant’s failure to settle affects others in the network |
| **Credit Risk** | Risk that a participant defaults on payment or delivery |
| **Legal Risk** | Inadequate legal frameworks in cross-border or multi-jurisdictional FMIs |
| **Systemic Risk** | Failure of an FMI can trigger cascading failures across the market |

## Regulatory and Global Standards

FMIs are subject to **strict oversight** due to their importance to financial stability. The global standard is the **CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)**, which define 24 key principles FMIs must follow, including:

- Governance

- Credit and liquidity risk management

- Settlement finality

- Default procedures

- Transparency and disclosure

- Cyber resilience

Key regulators and standard-setters:

- **CPMI (BIS)** – Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures

- **IOSCO** – International Organization of Securities Commissions

- **FSB** – Financial Stability Board

- **Local regulators** – (e.g., SEC, CFTC, ECB, FCA)

## Innovations and Future Outlook

| ****Trend**** | ****Impact on FMIs**** |
| **Tokenization of assets** | FMIs exploring how to support [digital securities](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/digital-assets/) and tokenized money |
| **Blockchain and DLT integration** | Experiments with distributed ledgers for settlement and clearing (e.g., RLNs, BIS projects) |
| **24/7 Real-time settlement** | Pushing traditional FMIs to match crypto market speeds |
| **Cybersecurity and resilience** | Increased investments in protection against cyber threats |
| **Cross-border harmonization** | Projects like ISO 20022 and BIS initiatives improve interoperability |

## Related Concepts

- **SWIFT**: A messaging network, not an FMI, but essential for [cross-border payments](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cross-border-payments/)

- **RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement)**: A type of payment system used by central banks

- **CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies)**: Could eventually integrate with or function as FMIs

- **Regulated Liability Networks (RLNs)**: A next-gen concept that may reshape FMI structures using tokenized money
