## Definition

Liquid staking allows cryptocurrency holders to stake their assets in a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain while still maintaining liquidity. Instead of locking tokens, users receive a liquid token representing their staked assets, which can be used across DeFi platforms.

## Background / Backstory on Liquid Staking

[Traditional staking requires locking up tokens to secure the network and earn reward](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/s/staking/)s. However, this creates an opportunity cost—users cannot access their funds until the staking period ends. It emerged as a solution, offering stakers a liquid derivative token they can trade, lend, or use in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications while still earning staking rewards.

## How it is Used in the Industry Today?

Liquid staking is gaining traction across Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains, decentralized finance (DeFi), and exchanges. It bridges staking and liquidity, enabling users to maximize capital efficiency.

### How It Works (Explained for a High-Schooler with an Analogy)

- Imagine you deposit $100 in a bank's fixed deposit account, earning interest. However, the bank gives you a special receipt worth $100 that you can trade, lend, or spend while still earning interest on your deposit.

- You stake your tokens, and in return, you receive a liquid staking token (e.g., stETH for Ethereum), which you can use across DeFi platforms.

### Example 1: Ethereum and stETH

- A user stakes ETH in [Lido Finance](https://faisalkhan.com/knowledge-center/how-cryptocurrency-works/comprehensive-guide-to-major-cryptocurrencies-and-tokens/what-is-lido-dao-ldo/).

- Lido issues **stETH** (staked ETH), representing the user's staked assets.

- The user can then use **stETH** in lending platforms, yield farming, or trading, all while still earning ETH staking rewards.

### Example 2: Solana and mSOL

- A user stakes SOL using Marinade Finance.

- They receive **mSOL**, which can be used in DeFi for additional yield opportunities.

- Meanwhile, their staked SOL continues generating staking rewards.

## Stakeholders and Implementation

### Who Uses It?

- **Retail and Institutional Investors** – Want staking rewards without sacrificing liquidity.

- **DeFi Platforms** – Utilize the tokens in lending, yield farming, and trading.

- **DAOs & Governance Participants** – Use staked assets without un-staking for governance voting.

- **Centralized exchanges** - offer solutions that help increase trading volumes by keeping crypto assets liquid.

### Challenges in Implementation

- **Smart Contract Risks** – It relies on complex smart contracts, which can have vulnerabilities.

- **Centralization Concerns** – Some liquid staking platforms control a large portion of staked assets.

- **Regulatory Uncertainty** – Some jurisdictions may consider liquid staking derivatives as securities.

## Pros & Cons 

### ✅ **Pros**

✔️ **Liquidity** – Users can still trade or use staked assets.

✔️ **Maximized Capital Efficiency** – Assets can earn rewards and be used in DeFi simultaneously.

✔️ **Composability** – Works seamlessly with lending, yield farming, and swaps.

### ❌ **Cons**

❌ **Smart Contract Risks** – Bugs or exploits in liquid staking platforms could result in losses.

❌ **Price Depegging** – The value of liquid staking tokens (e.g., stETH) may deviate from the underlying asset.

❌ **Regulatory Risks** – Authorities may impose restrictions on providers that offer staking services with liquid features.

## Future Outlook 

It is set to grow as blockchain networks transition to [Proof of Stake (PoS) ](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/p/proof-of-stake-pos/)and DeFi ecosystems mature. Key trends include:

- **Multi-Chain Expansion** – More blockchains adopting it.

- **Institutional Adoption** – Large funds leveraging liquid staking for yield generation.

- **Decentralized Liquid Staking** – New models aiming to mitigate centralization risks.
