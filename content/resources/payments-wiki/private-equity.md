Think of private equity like a gardener nurturing a plant. Just as a gardener invests time and effort to grow a plant, a private equity firm invests capital and expertise in companies. They nurture these companies, often through difficult periods, aiming to grow them into more valuable entities before finding the right time to 'harvest' their investment.
