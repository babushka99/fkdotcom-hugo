## Definition of Celebrity Memecoins

Celebrity memecoins are [cryptocurrencies](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cryptocurrency/) associated with famous personalities, often created as a novelty or to capitalize on an influencer's popularity. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which have robust blockchain use cases, memecoins largely rely on social media hype and community engagement to drive their value. While some memecoins are launched with genuine intent, others are accused of being pump-and-dump schemes designed to benefit early adopters at the expense of late investors.

## Background

The concept of [memecoins](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/m/meme-coins/) started with tokens like Dogecoin, which was created as a joke but later gained widespread adoption. As the cryptocurrency market evolved, celebrities and influencers began launching their own tokens, leveraging their social media influence to attract investors. High-profile figures such as Elon Musk, Floyd Mayweather, and Kim Kardashian have been linked to various memecoins, sometimes leading to legal challenges over misleading promotions. While some celebrity-backed coins have succeeded in building strong communities, many have collapsed shortly after launch due to a lack of real-world utility or investor confidence.
