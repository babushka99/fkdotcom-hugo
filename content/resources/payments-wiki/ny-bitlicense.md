### Is a BitLicense the same as a Money Transmitter License?

A BitLicense and a [money transmitter license](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/) are similar in some ways, but they are not the same thing.

A NY BitLicense is a specific type of license issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) that is required for any company or individual engaged in virtual currency business activity in the state of New York. This license is required for companies or individuals that engage in certain virtual currency activities in New York, such as buying and selling virtual currency, or holding virtual currency on behalf of others.

On the other hand, a money transmitter license is a type of license that is required for companies or individuals engaged in the business of transmitting money or monetary value. This can include activities such as money transfer services, currency exchange services, and check cashing services. Money transmitter licenses are issued by various state regulatory bodies, and the specific requirements for obtaining a license can vary depending on the state.

So while a NY BitLicense is a specific license required for virtual currency business activity in New York, a money transmitter license is a more general type of license that can be required for a wider range of money transmission activities in different states.
