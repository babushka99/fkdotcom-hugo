## Executive Summary

The Circle Payment Network (CPN), developed by Circle, is a blockchain-based payment protocol designed to revolutionize global transactions using regulated stablecoins like [USDC](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/u/usdc/) and EURC. By enabling seamless, compliant, and programmable payments, CPN addresses inefficiencies in legacy financial systems, offering faster, lower-cost transactions for businesses and individuals. It fosters innovation in [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/decentralized-finance-defi/) and global commerce but faces challenges such as regulatory compliance and onboarding complexities.

## Definition of Circle Payment Network (CPN)

The Circle Payment Network (CPN) is a coordination protocol that orchestrates global payments using stablecoins on public blockchain networks. Its core functionality enables financial institutions to facilitate fast, secure, and compliant transactions in fiat, USDC, EURC, and other regulated stablecoins. CPN aims to reduce the cost and complexity of cross-border payments while unlocking the programmability of digital money for innovative financial applications.

## Background / Backstory on Circle Payment Network (CPN)

Circle, a leader in the digital asset industry, developed CPN to address the limitations of legacy payment systems, which rely on pre-internet frameworks like ACH and [correspondent banking](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/correspondent-bank/). Launched to capitalize on the growing adoption of stablecoins and DeFi, CPN builds on Circle’s expertise with USDC and EURC to create a scalable, internet-native settlement system. It emerged from the need for a global, interoperable payment infrastructure that reduces fees, delays, and intermediary dependencies.

## How is Circle Payment Network (CPN) used in the Industry today?

CPN supports a wide range of payment use cases across industries:

- **Business Payments**: Facilitates supplier payments and trade finance by reducing settlement times and FX fees.

- **Retail Payments**: Powers global e-commerce and payroll disbursements with instant settlements.

- **Consumer Payments**: Enables low-cost remittances, subscriptions, and micropayments for content creators.

- **Institutional Payments**: Streamlines capital markets settlements, treasury services, and FX operations.

- **DeFi Integrations**: Supports lending, borrowing, and savings platforms with compliant cross-border flows.

## How Circle Payment Network (CPN) is used in the industry today and its significance

CPN transforms global finance by enabling near-instant, low-cost, and transparent payments, reducing reliance on fragmented legacy networks. Its significance lies in connecting traditional financial systems with blockchain-based stablecoins, fostering trust through compliance and governance. By lowering transaction costs (e.g., global remittance fees averaging 6.65% in Q2 2024) and enhancing speed, CPN strengthens supply chains, boosts financial inclusion, and drives innovation in digital commerce.

## How does it work?

CPN operates as a coordination protocol, orchestrating payments between Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) using stablecoins on blockchain networks:

- **Discovery**: [Originating Financial Institution (OFI)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/o/originating-financial-institution-ofi/) query CPN to find [Beneficiary Financial Institution (BFI)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/beneficiary-financial-institution-bfi/) and liquidity for specific currency pairs.

- **Transaction Initiation**: OFIs convert fiat to stablecoins (e.g., USDC) and initiate payments via APIs or smart contracts.

- **Orchestration**: CPN validates and routes transactions across blockchains, leveraging the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) for secure transfers.

- **Settlement**: BFIs receive stablecoins, either holding them or converting to local fiat for recipients.

- **Example 1**: A Mexican manufacturer pays a German supplier by converting MXN to USDC via an OFI. CPN routes the USDC to a German BFI, which converts it to EUR and settles instantly, avoiding multi-day bank transfers.

- **Example 2**: A U.S. remittance sender transfers money to the Philippines. An OFI converts USD to USDC, and CPN connects to a Philippine BFI, delivering PHP to the recipient in near-real-time at lower fees.

## ELI5

Imagine CPN as a super-fast delivery service for money, like a global teleportation device. Instead of waiting days for your cash to travel through slow banks, CPN zaps your digital money (like USDC) across the world instantly, safely, and cheaply. It’s like sending a package from New York to Tokyo in seconds, without extra stops or fees!

## Stakeholders and Implementation

Key stakeholders include:

- **Circle**: Governs CPN, sets rules, and operates the network.

- **Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs)**: Banks, [VASP](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/v/vasp/)s, and PSPs acting as OFIs or BFIs to process payments.

- **End Users**: Businesses and individuals benefiting from faster, cheaper transactions.

- **Service Providers**: Liquidity providers, stablecoin issuers, and tech vendors offering FX, custody, and compliance solutions.

- **Implementation Process**:

**Eligibility**: PFIs undergo rigorous vetting for AML/CFT, sanctions compliance, and financial strength.

- **Integration**: PFIs integrate CPN’s APIs, SDKs, or smart contracts into their systems.

- **Operation**: PFIs execute transactions, monitor compliance, and leverage CPN’s orchestration tools.

- **Challenges**: Regulatory hurdles, technical complexities, and the need for broader stablecoin adoption among traditional institutions.

### Pros & Cons

**Pros:**

- Near-instant, low-cost global payments

- Compliant framework supporting AML/CFT and Travel Rule standards

- Programmable stablecoins enabling innovative use cases **Cons:**

- Regulatory uncertainties across jurisdictions

- Onboarding and technical integration complexities

- Limited initial blockchain and stablecoin support

## Future Outlook

CPN is poised to reshape global payments as stablecoin adoption grows and regulatory frameworks mature. Future expansions include support for additional blockchains and stablecoins, fully [on-chain](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/o/on-chain/) FX routing, and third-party integrations for lending, escrow, and AI-driven payments. By fostering a competitive marketplace for financial services, CPN could reduce global transaction costs and enhance financial inclusion, aligning with the internet’s transformative impact on commerce.
