The blockchain economy encapsulates a broad ecosystem driven by the underlying technology of blockchain. This decentralized ledger technology is the backbone of cryptocurrencies, altcoins, meme coins, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), and more. It represents a shift from traditional, centralized financial systems to a decentralized model where transactions and data are recorded across a network of computers.

### Brief Overview

It encompasses various applications, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, platforms for decentralized finance (DeFi), [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/n/nft-non-fungible-tokens/), and more. This economy leverages the transparency, security, and efficiency of blockchain technology to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks.
