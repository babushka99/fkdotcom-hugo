## Definition of Retail Payments
Retail payments refer to financial transactions conducted in the retail sector, where consumers purchase goods and services. This can involve various payment methods, including [cash](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cash/), credit and debit cards, [digital wallets](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/digital-wallet/), and mobile payment solutions. The aim is to facilitate seamless transactions between consumers and merchants, ensuring that the process is efficient and secure.
## Background / Backstory on Retail Payments
Historically, retail payments began with cash transactions, the most basic form. As commerce evolved, so did payment methods, leading to the introduction of checks, [credit cards](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/credit-card/), and ultimately [digital payments](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/digital-payments/). The rise of e-commerce significantly transformed retail payments, necessitating the development of secure online payment systems. Today, retail payments encompass a wide array of methods designed to meet consumer preferences and technological advancements.
## How Retail Payments is Used in the Industry Today
Today, retail payments integrate various methods to meet consumer demands. In stores, consumers often pay using credit and debit cards, while online shopping has led to increased usage of digital wallets (like PayPal and Apple Pay) and mobile payment options. [Payment processors](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/p/payment-processor/), gateways, and merchant accounts work in the background to facilitate these transactions, ensuring they are completed swiftly and securely.
## How Retail Payments Works
To explain retail payments simply, consider two examples:

 	- **In-store Purchase with a Card**:

 	A customer selects items and heads to the checkout.
 	- The cashier swipes the customer’s credit card through a card reader.
 	- The card reader connects to a payment processor that verifies if the card has enough funds.
 	- Upon approval, the transaction is completed, and the customer receives a receipt.

 	- **Online Purchase with a Digital Wallet**:

 	A customer shops on an e-commerce website and adds items to their cart.
 	- At checkout, they select the digital wallet option (like PayPal).
 	- They log in to their wallet account, confirm the payment, and the system processes it securely.
 	- The merchant receives confirmation, and the customer gets an order confirmation email.

## ELI5
Imagine you want to buy a toy from a store. If you give the store your money (cash), they give you the toy. But if you use a credit card, it’s like showing them a magic card that promises you’ll pay later. When you buy something online, it’s like sending a message to your friend who has the toy, asking them to send it to you after you promise to pay using your magic card on your phone!
## Stakeholders and Implementation
The main stakeholders in retail payments include consumers, merchants, [payment service providers (PSPs)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/p/payment-service-provider-psp/), and financial institutions. Consumers expect easy and secure transactions while merchants seek efficient payment solutions that minimize costs.
