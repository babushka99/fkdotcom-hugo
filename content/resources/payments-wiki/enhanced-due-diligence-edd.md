### Definition

**Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)** is an in-depth procedure for financial institutions to assess the risk that clients may pose before establishing a business relationship. It goes beyond Simple Due Diligence (SDD) by requiring additional information to establish the identity, background, and financial activities of the prospective client. EDD is typically used for high-risk customers, where the standard due diligence process is not sufficient to mitigate potential risks.

### Usage Context

Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is primarily utilized in scenarios involving high-risk customers, complex transactions, and situations that present a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. This includes, but is not limited to, dealing with politically exposed persons (PEPs), cross-border transactions, and sectors known for higher risks such as cryptocurrencies.

### Importance of Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)

EDD is crucial for mitigating financial risks and ensuring compliance with [anti-money laundering (AML)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/anti-money-laundering-aml/) and [counter-terrorist financing (CTF)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/counter-terrorism-financing-ctf/) regulations. It helps in identifying suspicious activities and preventing financial crimes. By thoroughly vetting clients, financial institutions can maintain their integrity, avoid hefty penalties for non-compliance, and protect their reputation.

### Users

The primary users of Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) include banks, credit unions, payment service providers, cryptocurrency exchanges, and other financial institutions. Regulatory bodies and government agencies also interact with EDD processes through audits and compliance checks.

### Application

The application of EDD involves collecting extensive information about the customer, including source of funds, the purpose of the account or transaction, and the expected pattern of activity. It may also require ongoing monitoring to detect any suspicious activities. Financial institutions use various methods for this, such as background checks, reviewing public and private databases, and analyzing transaction patterns.

### Different Names

Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is also known as:

- Enhanced Customer Due Diligence (ECDD)

- Intensive Due Diligence

### Moral Issues

Moral issues surrounding EDD include privacy concerns, as it involves collecting and analyzing detailed personal and financial information. There's also the risk of discrimination against individuals or businesses deemed high-risk without sufficient basis.

### Pros and Cons of Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)

**Pros:**

- Mitigates the risk of financial crimes.

- Ensures compliance with global regulations.

- Protects the financial system's integrity.

**Cons:**

- Can be resource-intensive and costly.

- May slow down the customer onboarding process.

- Raises privacy and discrimination concerns.

### Real-World Examples

- **Banks vetting politically exposed persons (PEPs):** Major banks use EDD processes to scrutinize the accounts and transactions of PEPs to prevent corruption and money laundering.

- **Cryptocurrency exchanges applying EDD:** Exchanges like Coinbase and Binance implement EDD for high-volume traders or suspicious accounts to comply with [AML regulations](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/aml-law/).

- **International trade financing:** Financial institutions offering trade financing services use EDD to ensure the legitimacy of the businesses and goods involved, especially in high-risk regions.

### Analogies

Think of EDD as the deep cleaning of financial hygiene. Just as deep cleaning targets hidden dirt that regular cleaning might miss, EDD delves into a customer's financial background to uncover risks that standard due diligence could overlook. This thorough examination ensures that the financial institution's environment remains clean and compliant, free from the dirt of financial crimes.
