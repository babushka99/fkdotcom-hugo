A Visa Interchange Table is a comprehensive chart or document provided by Visa, one of the world's leading [payment networks](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/card-networks/), that lists the various interchange fees charged for different types of card transactions. Interchange fees are transaction fees that a merchant's bank (acquiring bank) pays to the cardholder's bank (issuing bank) for processing card payments. These fees are a significant component of the overall costs merchants incur when they accept card payments. The Visa Interchange Table is designed to bring transparency to this aspect of card payment processing.

The Visa Interchange Table typically displays:

- **Interchange Fees**: Listed as percentages of the transaction amount plus a fixed fee. For example, a common structure might be 1.65% + $0.10 per transaction.

- **Transaction Types**: Different fees may apply to various transaction types, such as in-person (card-present) transactions, online (card-not-present) transactions, and others.
