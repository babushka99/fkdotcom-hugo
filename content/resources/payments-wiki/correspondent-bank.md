## **TL;DR**

A correspondent bank acts as an agent for another bank, enabling international transactions when the banks involved don't have a direct relationship. It plays a key role in global finance and cross-border payments.

## **Definition and Origin**

A correspondent bank is a [financial institution](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/financial-institution-fi/) that provides services on behalf of another bank, particularly in international transactions. The relationship allows banks to exchange foreign currencies and conduct business in countries where they don't have a physical presence. The concept dates back to the early days of international banking when banks needed to form partnerships to facilitate global trade.

## **Simplest Explanation in Payments**

In payments, a correspondent bank acts as a go-between, helping one bank move money to another in a different country by providing services like currency exchange or clearing transactions.

## **Type of Correspondent Banks**

They can be divided into:

- **Nostro Accounts:** Accounts held by a bank in another country’s currency.

- **Vostro Accounts:** Accounts a correspondent bank holds on behalf of another bank.

- **Loro Accounts:** Accounts that refer to accounts of third parties that are handled by correspondent banks on behalf of the primary banks.

## **Everyday Life Usage**

For example, if you send money internationally through your local bank, that bank might use a correspondent bank to convert your funds into the recipient's currency and deliver it to their bank.
