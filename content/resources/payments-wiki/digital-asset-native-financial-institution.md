## DefinitionÂ 
A Digital Asset Native Financial Institution is a specialized financial entity that is built from the ground up to operate within the digital asset ecosystem. This includes the handling of [cryptocurrencies](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cryptocurrency/), tokenized assets, and services that utilize [blockchain technology](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/blockchain/) for transactions. Unlike traditional financial institutions, which typically incorporate digital assets as an afterthought, these entities are designed to leverage the advantages of digital finance inherently.

## Background / Backstory
The rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology has prompted a transformative shift in the financial industry. Initially dominated by traditional banks and payment systems, the financial landscape has gradually evolved to include [digital assets](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/digital-assets/). The advent of [Bitcoin](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/bitcoin/) in 2009 marked the beginning of this shift, leading to a plethora of digital currencies and the development of [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/decentralized-finance-defi/). As blockchain technology matured, the need for financial institutions that cater specifically to the needs of this new ecosystem became apparent. Thus, Digital Asset Native Financial Institutions emerged, serving as facilitators of crypto transactions, tokenized asset management, and innovative financial services.

## How it is used in the Industry today
Digital Asset Native Financial Institutions are utilized in various ways within the financial industry. They provide services such as custody of digital assets, offering crypto payment solutions, and engaging in trading of cryptocurrencies and tokens. They are involved in lending and borrowing against cryptocurrencies, and they facilitate the conversion between traditional fiat currencies and digital assets.

### Significance in the Industry Today
The significance of these institutions lies in their ability to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized financial ecosystem. They enhance transaction efficiency, reduce costs, and offer novel investment opportunities. As they operate on blockchain technology, they ensure transparency and security, fostering trust among users. Institutions like these represent a pivotal shift in how consumers and businesses perceive financial services, pushing the boundaries of [traditional banking](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/banking/).

## How does it work?
To explain how Digital Asset Native Financial Institutions work, let's consider two examples:

- 
**Crypto Banking**: Imagine a bank where people can deposit cryptocurrencies instead of just traditional money. This bank allows customers to earn interest on their crypto holdings or even obtain loans by collateralizing their digital assets.

- 
**Tokenized Asset Management**: Think of a platform that allows you to invest in real estate not by purchasing a whole property but by buying tokens representing shares in that property. This simplifies real estate investing, allowing for [fractional ownership](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/fractional-ownership-in-crypto-a-comprehensive-guide/) and increased liquidity.

### ELI5
If I were to explain this to a 5-year-old, I would say:

- A Digital Asset Native Financial Institution is like a special toy store where you can keep your digital toys safe, trade them with your friends, and sometimes even get new toys in return for letting other kids play with your toys.
- This store uses super smart technology (blockchains) to make sure you always know where your toys are and who has them!

## Stakeholders and Implementation
