### Definition and Origin

**Passive Income** refers to earnings derived from a rental property, limited partnership, or other enterprise in which a person is not actively involved. Unlike active income, which is earned from performing a service, passive income is generated through investments or business activities that do not require the earner's direct involvement. The concept has roots in the early investment and business strategies where individuals sought ways to earn money without committing to the time and labor typically required for active income. Over time, it has evolved to encompass a variety of revenue streams, including dividends, interest, royalties, and income from automated businesses or investments.

### Usage Context and Evolution

In the banking and financial industry, passive income is typically used as a strategy for wealth accumulation and financial stability. Initially, it was predominantly associated with rental income and dividends from stock investments. However, its application has significantly broadened with the advent of digital finance. Today, it includes earnings from online platforms, peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding, and cryptocurrency staking.

For the financial sector, the growth in alternative income strategies has led to the development of new financial products and services, such as robo-advisors and automated investment platforms, transforming how individuals and institutions approach investment and wealth management.

### Key Stakeholders and Users

Passive income is applied through various methodologies and technologies, including dividend investing, real estate investment trusts (REITs), peer-to-peer lending, cryptocurrency staking, and automated trading algorithms. Implementation challenges include identifying reliable income streams, managing risk, and staying informed about regulatory changes. Successful implementation often requires a combination of financial acumen, technological tools, and ongoing education.

Passive income is also known as residual income or unearned income. While the terms are often used interchangeably, nuances exist; residual income can specifically refer to money earned after the initial effort has been completed, and unearned income can include inheritances or gifts.
