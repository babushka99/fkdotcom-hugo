### Definition

A Community Bank is a financial institution that provides [traditional banking services](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/banking/), focusing primarily on meeting the needs of local communities and businesses. Unlike large, multinational banks, community banks are known for their personal customer service, local decision-making, and commitment to the economic development of their communities.

### A Close Look at Community Banks

Community banks define themselves through a commitment to serving the local communities in which they are established. This usually translates to a focus on providing financial services, loans, and support to local businesses, farmers, and individual residents. The defining characteristic of community banks lies in their intimate understanding of local needs, enabling them to craft services and products that are inherently tailored to the community they serve.

### Chartering and Licensing

The establishment and operation of community banks in the United States are subject to both federal and state regulations. Banks can acquire a charter from either a state regulator or a federal regulator. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is the primary federal authority that issues charters to banks, while various state banking departments regulate and charter banks at the state level.

### Distinctions from Larger Banks

One of the prominent distinctions between community banks and larger banking entities is scale and focus. CBs traditionally operate within a confined geographical area, providing specialized services that cater directly to the specific needs of the local populace. This localized focus typically translates into a more personalized customer experience, community-oriented decision-making, and an intrinsic connection to local economic success.

### Regulatory Protocols

CBs are subject to regulation by both federal and state entities, depending on their charter. [Federally chartered banks](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/s/state-chartered-bank/) are regulated by entities such as the OCC, while state-chartered banks are subject to regulation by their respective state's banking authority. Additionally, other federal agencies, such as the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), play roles in regulation and oversight.

### FDIC Insurance and Federal Reserve Membership

Community banks can be insured by the FDIC, which provides a safeguard for depositor funds up to $250,000 per depositor. This ensures that customersâ€™ deposits are secure, fostering confidence in the banking institution.

Furthermore, community banks may choose to be members of the Federal Reserve System, though it is not a mandate, depending on their charter and regulatory adherence.

### The Allure of Community Banks

Aligning oneself with a community bank offers a multitude of advantages. Not only do these institutions commonly provide a more personalized and accessible customer service experience, but they also channel funds back into the local economy, supporting local businesses, development projects, and community endeavors.
