In the context of banking and payments, the term "rails" is a metaphorical way to describe the underlying infrastructure and networks that enable the movement of money from one place to another. They are not physical rail lines, but rather virtual pathways or channels that facilitate financial transactions. Here's a breakdown of the different types of "rails" you mentioned:

- **Payment Rails:** This term generally refers to the methods and networks used to process monetary transactions. These can include traditional banking networks, electronic funds transfer systems like SWIFT (used for international bank transfers), and [Automated Clearing House (ACH)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/automated-clearing-house-ach/) networks (used for domestic transfers in countries like the USA).

- **Card Rails:** When someone refers to "card rails," they are talking about the networks used to process debit and credit card transactions. These networks are maintained by card associations like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc. When you swipe your card at a store, the transaction travels through these card rails to authenticate and process the payment.

- **ATM Rails:** These are the networks that connect different [ATMs](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/automated-teller-machine-atm/) to banks and allow customers to withdraw cash, check balances, or perform other banking transactions. The ATM rails ensure that when you use an ATM, even one that is not operated by your bank, the transaction is routed correctly and your account is debited.

- **Crypto Rails:** In the context of cryptocurrencies, "rails" refer to the blockchain networks and related technology that facilitate the transfer of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. These rails are decentralized and operate differently from traditional banking rails, relying on blockchain technology for secure, peer-to-peer transactions.

- **Bank Rails:** refers to the traditional banking networks and systems used for processing financial transactions. This term encompasses a broad range of activities and services that banks offer to facilitate the movement of money. Hereâ€™s a bit more detail:

**Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Networks:** These are systems that enable the electronic transfer of money from one bank account to another. EFT networks include domestic systems like ACH in the U.S., which handles transactions like direct deposit, payroll, and bill payments.

- **Wire Transfer Systems:** For more immediate and typically larger transactions, particularly international ones, banks use wire transfer systems like [SWIFT](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/s/society-for-worldwide-interbank-financial-telecommunication-swift/). These systems allow for the secure and rapid transfer of funds across borders.

- **Interbank Networks:** Banks are interconnected through various interbank networks, enabling them to communicate and process transactions like check clearing, ATM withdrawals, and more.

- **Banking APIs and Digital Infrastructure:** With the rise of [digital banking](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/digital-bank/), "bank rails" also include the technological infrastructure that supports online and mobile banking. This can encompass everything from digital payment services to APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that integrate banking services with other financial technology applications.

- When someone in the banking industry refers to "bank rails," they are typically talking about these traditional, often established systems and networks that banks use to manage and process financial transactions. These rails are the backbone of everyday banking operations, ensuring that money moves securely and efficiently between accounts, banks, and even across national borders.

So, when someone in the banking and payments industry talks about building or using "rails," they are referring to setting up or utilizing these various networks and systems that enable the movement and processing of financial transactions in different forms.
