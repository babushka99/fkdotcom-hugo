## Definition of Remittance Business
The remittance business refers to the financial services and transactions that enable individuals to send money from one location to another, often across borders. It typically involves the transfer of funds from foreign workers to their families back home, facilitating economic support and development in various communities.
## Background / Backstory on Remittance Business
The practice of sending money abroad dates back centuries, with various methods evolving over time. Historically, remittances were sent through informal channels, such as family members traveling back home. In the late 20th century, the rise of formal money transfer systems saw the establishment of companies dedicated to remittances, making the process more efficient and regulated. This evolution has been fueled by globalization, migration patterns, and the increasing need for financial services tailored to diverse populations.
## How is Remittance Business Used in the Industry Today
Today, the remittance business encapsulates a diverse range of services from traditional bank transfers to innovative digital solutions. The industry facilitates:

 	- Money transfers between countries (cross-border)
 	- Domestic transfers within a country
 	- Instant or scheduled payments
 	- Payments for goods and services ([B2B payments](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/business-to-business-b2b/))
 	- Various payment methods, including mobile, online, in-person, and in cryptocurrency

The significance of remittances has grown, especially in developing countries, where they contribute significantly to household earnings and local economies.
## How Remittance Business Works
To understand how the remittance business operates, let's consider two examples:

 	- **International Money Transfer:**

 	A migrant worker in the United States wants to send money to their family in Mexico. They use a service like Western Union or a digital platform like TransferWise. The migrant pays the equivalent amount in dollars, and the service charges a fee. The company processes the payment and delivers the amount in pesos to the recipient at a local pickup point or directly to their bank account.

 	- **Peer-to-Peer Money Transfer:**

 	Two friends, one in Canada and one in the UK, want to split a cost for a concert ticket. They use a mobile app like Venmo or PayPal. The friend in Canada sends the amount instantly using their app, which converts Canadian dollars to British pounds. The transaction is executed within seconds, allowing for seamless sharing of expenses.

## ELI5
Imagine you want to share your candy with a friend who lives far away. You give your candy to a magical delivery person who promises to deliver it. They take your candy, travel to your friend's house, and give it to them. This is like sending money across borders â€“ you give it to someone (the remittance service), they take it, and deliver it to your friend!
## Stakeholders and Implementation
The key players in the remittance business include:

 	- **Consumers:** Individuals sending money.
 	- **Banks and Financial Institutions:** Provide the infrastructure for money transfers.
