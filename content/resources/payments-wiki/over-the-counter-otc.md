"Over-the-Counter" (OTC) refers to the process of trading financial instruments, such as stocks, [bonds](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/bonds/), commodities, or cryptocurrencies, directly between two parties without the use of a centralized exchange. This type of trading is conducted through dealer networks rather than on a centralized exchange like the New York Stock Exchange.

### Definition and How It Works

- **OTC Trading**: Involves two parties negotiating directly with each other. This is in contrast to exchange trading, where orders are matched between buyers and sellers in a centralized manner.

- **Role of Dealers**: In OTC markets, dealers act as market makers by quoting prices at which they will buy and sell a security or asset.

- **Negotiation and Flexibility**: Parties can negotiate terms, price, and quantity, allowing for customized trading agreements.

### Key Entities Involved in Over-the-Counter (OTC)

- **Buyers and Sellers**: Ranging from individual investors to large institutions.

- **Brokers/Dealers**: Facilitate trades by connecting buyers and sellers and providing liquidity.

### Differences from 'Under the Counter'

- **'Under the Counter'**: This term is typically used to describe illegal or unregulated transactions. It's not an official financial term like Over-the-Counter (OTC).

- **Legality and Regulation**: [OTC trading](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/o/otc-trading/) is legal and regulated, albeit less strictly than exchange trading, while 'under the counter' implies illicit activities.

### Benefits of OTC

- **Flexibility**: Customizable terms for each trade.

- **Privacy**: Trades are not publicly disclosed, offering confidentiality.

- **Access to Non-Listed Securities**: Enables trading in securities not listed on formal exchanges.

### Drawbacks of Over-the-Counter (OTC)

- **Counterparty Risk**: Higher risk of one party defaulting as there's no centralized clearinghouse.

- **Lack of Transparency**: Prices and trades are not publicly reported, which can lead to less favorable pricing.

- **Regulatory Risks**: Less oversight compared to exchange trading.

### Examples

- **Corporate Bonds**: Often traded OTC, where a company might sell bonds directly to an institution.

- **Small-Cap Stocks**: Some small companies trade their stocks OTC, as they don't meet the requirements to list on an exchange.

- **Cryptocurrency Transactions**: Many crypto trades occur Over-the-Counter (OTC), especially large-volume trades that might affect the market if placed on an exchange.

### Conclusion

OTC trading offers flexibility and access to certain types of securities not available on exchanges, but comes with increased risks like counterparty and [regulatory risks](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/r/regulatory-enforcement/). It serves a vital role in the financial ecosystem, especially for institutional investors and large transactions that might be impractical or disruptive if conducted on traditional exchanges.
