### Definition and Origin

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are nations with a gross national income (GNI) per capita below a certain threshold set annually by the World Bank. This classification helps in understanding and assessing the economic standing of countries in the global context. The origins of this classification can be traced back to the late 20th century when global organizations sought to categorize countries for developmental assistance and policy formulation. Over time, this classification has evolved, reflecting changes in global economics, income levels, and developmental priorities.

Financial services in LMICs are now characterized by rapid technological adoption, aiming to leapfrog traditional banking stages.
