## Brief Definition and Origin

The Nigerian Prince Scam is a classic form of [advance-fee fraud ](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/advance-fee-fraud/)where scammers pose as a wealthy individual‚Äîoften royalty, a government official, or banker‚Äîoffering the victim a share of a large fortune in exchange for upfront help with banking fees, legal costs, or bribes. The victim sends money expecting a huge reward, but the scammer disappears with the funds.

This scam is formally classified under ‚Äú[419 fraud](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/0-9/419-scams/)‚Äù, referencing Section 419 of the Nigerian Criminal Code, which deals with obtaining property by false pretenses. While the scam gained global attention in the early 2000s via email, its roots date back to 18th-century European ‚ÄúSpanish prisoner‚Äù scams, where victims were tricked into paying to free a wealthy captive.

## Explain Like I‚Äôm 5 (ELI5)

Imagine someone writes you a letter and says, **‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm a prince! I have $10 million, but I need your help to get it out. If you send me some money, I‚Äôll give you a big reward!‚Äù** You send them your allowance, but they never give you anything back. That‚Äôs the **Nigerian Prince scam**.

## How the Nigerian Prince Scam Works

- **Initial Contact**: You receive an email (or sometimes a letter, DM, or message) from a person claiming to be a prince, diplomat, banker, or official.

- **The Story**: They say they have access to a large sum of money‚Äîan inheritance, oil fortune, government fund, or bank transfer.

- **The Hook**: They need **your help** to ‚Äúmove‚Äù the money out of the country due to legal or political reasons. In return, you‚Äôll get a **huge percentage** (often millions).

- **Advance Fee**: They ask you to send a small payment to cover ‚Äútransfer fees,‚Äù ‚Äútaxes,‚Äù ‚Äúlegal documents,‚Äù or ‚Äúprocessing costs.‚Äù

- **Escalation**: Once you pay, they invent new reasons for additional payments.

- **The Exit**: Eventually, the scammer cuts off communication or disappears with all the money you sent.

These scams often involve **fake documents**, **government seals**, and even **[phone calls](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/call-center-scam/)** from fake "officials" to make the scheme more believable.
