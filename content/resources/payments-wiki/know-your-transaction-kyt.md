KYT or "Know Your Transaction" is a term used in the financial industry, particularly in the context of [anti-money laundering](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/risk-and-compliance/anti-money-laundering-aml/) (AML) and [counter-terrorism financing](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/risk-and-compliance/counter-terrorism-financing-ctf/) (CTF) regulations. It refers to the process of monitoring and analyzing financial transactions to identify suspicious activities that may be associated with money laundering or terrorist financing.

Know Your Transaction (KYT) is a proactive approach that allows financial institutions to detect and report suspicious transactions to the relevant authorities. It involves collecting and analyzing transaction data in real-time, and using advanced analytical tools to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate illegal activities.

In the cryptocurrency world, KYT is used by [virtual asset service providers](https://faisalkhan.com/knowledge-hub/resources-and-references/virtual-asset-service-provider/) ([VASP](https://faisalkhan.com/knowledge-hub/resources-and-references/virtual-asset-service-provider/)s) to comply with AML/CFT regulations. VASPs are companies that provide exchange, transfer, and custody services for cryptocurrencies, and they are subject to the same AML/CFT rules as traditional financial institutions.

Know Your Transaction (KYT) in the cryptocurrency context involves tracking cryptocurrency transactions and identifying patterns of behavior that may indicate illegal activities, such as money laundering or terrorist financing. This may include monitoring the source and destination of funds, the amount of cryptocurrency transferred, and the frequency of transactions.

Know Your Transaction (KYT) is an important tool for VASPs to prevent the abuse of cryptocurrencies for illegal activities. In some jurisdictions, it may also be a legal requirement for VASPs to implement KYT as part of their AML/CFT [compliance program](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/compliance-program/).

Overall, Know Your Transaction (KYT) is a critical component of AML/CFT compliance, helping financial institutions and VASPs to detect and prevent illegal activities.
