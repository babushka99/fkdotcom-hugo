## TL;DR

The BDS Movement, which stands for **Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions**, is a global campaign advocating for economic, cultural, and political pressure on Israel to achieve rights and justice for Palestinians. The movement, initiated in 2005, encourages individuals, institutions, and governments to boycott Israeli goods, divest from companies involved with Israel, and impose sanctions until Israel complies with international law and respects Palestinian rights.

## Executive Summary

The BDS Movement, or Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement, is an international effort to apply non-violent pressure on Israel in support of Palestinian rights. Launched in 2005 by Palestinian civil society, BDS calls for a global boycott of Israeli goods and companies, divestment from institutions supporting Israel’s actions, and sanctions until Israel respects international laws regarding Palestinian rights. Modeled on the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, BDS is both supported and opposed by different political, academic, and cultural groups. Supporters view it as a form of peaceful protest, while critics argue it targets Israel unfairly and negatively impacts prospects for peace.

## What is the BDS Movement? A Detailed Overview

### Definition and Concept

The **BDS Movement** stands for **Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions** and represents a global campaign aimed at applying economic and political pressure on Israel. The movement was founded in 2005 by Palestinian civil society groups who sought an organized, peaceful approach to advocate for the rights of Palestinians. BDS calls on individuals, companies, academic institutions, and governments to participate in actions that pressure Israel to comply with international law and respect Palestinian rights.

The movement is built on three main pillars:

- **Boycott** - Encourages consumers and institutions to avoid Israeli goods, cultural products, and academic institutions.

- **Divestment** - Urges businesses and institutions to withdraw investments from Israeli companies and others that support Israeli actions.

- **Sanctions** - Calls on governments to implement diplomatic and economic sanctions against Israel to compel it to change its policies.

Inspired by the global anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, BDS views economic pressure as a non-violent way to demand justice, equal rights, and freedom for Palestinians.

### How the BDS Movement Works

- **Boycott of Israeli Goods and Services:**

Individuals and organizations are encouraged to avoid purchasing Israeli products, participating in cultural exchanges, or supporting Israeli institutions, which generates economic pressure.

- **Divestment from Supporting Companies:**

BDS advocates urge universities, churches, and investment funds to pull their investments from companies that operate in Israel or support Israeli policies toward Palestinians.

- **Sanctions through Political Pressure:**

BDS promotes lobbying efforts to persuade governments to place diplomatic or economic sanctions on Israel to encourage policy changes.

- **Advocacy and Public Awareness:**

BDS raises awareness about Palestinian rights through educational campaigns, public events, and media, encouraging broader support for its goals.

### Goals of the BDS Movement

BDS aims to end Israel's occupation of lands captured in 1967, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and seeks the dismantling of Israeli settlements in these areas.

- **Equal Rights for Palestinian Citizens of Israel:**

The movement advocates for full rights and equality for Palestinians who are citizens of Israel, addressing issues of discrimination.

- **Right of Return for Palestinian Refugees:**

BDS calls for recognizing the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes or receive compensation, as per United Nations resolutions.

- **Concerns Over Negative Impact on Peace Efforts:**

Some believe that BDS polarizes the conflict further, making it harder for Israelis and Palestinians to find common ground.

- **Economic Impact on Both Israelis and Palestinians:**

Critics argue that boycotts harm not only Israeli businesses but also Palestinian workers and the regional economy, which relies on interconnected markets.

- **Allegations of Anti-Semitism:**

BDS faces accusations of fostering anti-Semitic sentiments, as opponents claim it delegitimizes the state of Israel, although BDS states it opposes Israeli policy, not Judaism.

### Examples of BDS in Action

- **University Divestment Campaigns:**

Many universities have seen student-led campaigns urging their institutions to divest from companies that operate in Israel, leading to debates on campuses worldwide.
