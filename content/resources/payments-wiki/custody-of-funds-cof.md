## Origins and Backstory of Custody of Funds (COF)

The concept of custody of funds has deep roots in financial systems. Historically, it originated from the need for trusted entities—like banks and money lenders—to safeguard assets for individuals who couldn’t do so themselves.

In modern financial services, COF became a focal point with the rise of money services businesses (MSBs) and digital payment systems. Regulatory bodies worldwide have since placed greater emphasis on COF to ensure the safety and integrity of customer funds.

## Key Principles of Custody of Funds

### 1. Safeguarding Assets

Businesses holding custody of funds must implement measures to protect them from theft, [fraud](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/fraud/), or mismanagement. This includes maintaining secure bank accounts and adhering to strict internal controls.

### 2. Availability

Funds held in custody must be readily accessible to customers. Businesses are obligated to ensure liquidity to meet withdrawal or transfer requests promptly.

### 4. Risk Management

Businesses must mitigate risks associated with COF, including operational, financial, and reputational risks, by adhering to best practices and regulations.
