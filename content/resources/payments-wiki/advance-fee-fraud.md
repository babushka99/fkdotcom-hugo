## Introduction to Advance Fee Fraud

Advance fee fraud is a type of scam where victims are persuaded to pay money upfront (an "advance fee") with the promise of receiving a significantly larger sum later, which never materializes. This confidence trick has evolved over centuries but gained particular notoriety in the digital age.

## History and Origins of Advance Fee Fraud

Advance fee fraud dates back centuries, with early versions appearing in the form of the "Spanish Prisoner" scam in the late 16th century. In this historical version, victims were contacted by someone claiming to be a wealthy person imprisoned in Spain who needed funds for bribes to secure their release, promising a share of their fortune in return.

The modern incarnation gained global prominence in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of Nigerian advance fee fraud, commonly known as "[419 scams](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/0-9/419-scams/)" (named after the relevant section of the Nigerian Criminal Code). These typically involved letters and faxes, and later emails, claiming to come from Nigerian officials or businesspeople seeking help to transfer large sums of money out of the country.

With the advent of the internet, advance fee fraud has proliferated globally, adopting countless variations while maintaining the core premise of requesting upfront payment for a larger future return.

## How Advance Fee Fraud Works (ELI5)

Imagine someone tells you they'll give you $100 if you first give them $10. They come up with a convincing story about why they need your $10 first - maybe they need to pay for an envelope to send you the $100, or they need to pay a fee to access their bank account. Once you send the $10, they either disappear or come up with another reason why they need more money from you. This cycle continues, but you never get the promised $100.

That's advance fee fraud. Scammers promise you something valuable (money, prizes, jobs, relationships) but claim they need you to pay something first. The promised reward never comes, and they often try to get more and more money from you.

## Impact and Statistics

Advance fee fraud costs victims billions of dollars annually worldwide. The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) regularly ranks these scams among the most financially damaging types of internet fraud. Beyond financial loss, victims often experience emotional trauma, shame, and in some cases, become unwitting participants in [money laundering](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/m/money-laundering/) schemes.

Senior citizens are particularly vulnerable targets, with studies showing they lose more money to scams per capita than younger demographics. Businesses are also targeted through more sophisticated versions of these schemes.

## Global Response

Law enforcement agencies worldwide collaborate to combat advance fee fraud, though prosecution can be challenging due to the international nature of many scams. Organizations like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) work to develop policies against money laundering and fraud.

Many countries have established dedicated cybercrime units to investigate these cases, and financial institutions have implemented various security measures to detect suspicious transactions.
