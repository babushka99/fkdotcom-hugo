### What Does Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) Imply?

Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) implies an alternative financing option that enables consumers to acquire goods or services immediately but defer the payment. Often, customers can choose to repay the amount in several installments, typically without interest if paid within a specified period, or with added interest or fees if the repayment extends beyond that period.

### Industry Vertical or Payment Type?

BNPL can be considered as both an industry vertical and a specific type of payment.
