## Executive Summary

- **Web Monetization** is a standardized way for creators to receive payments for their work online.

- Built on the **Web Monetization API**, which enables seamless microtransactions via payment pointers.

- Designed for efficiency, allowing users to pay for content without subscriptions or repetitive payment forms.

- Supported by the **Interledger Protocol (ILP)** for fast, secure payments.

- Provides new opportunities for content creators, publishers, and service providers.

## Origins and Backstory

Web Monetization emerged to address challenges in traditional monetization methods like intrusive advertising, expensive subscriptions, and the inefficiency of small-scale payments. The concept gained traction through the development of the **Interledger Protocol (ILP)** by Coil, a pioneering company. ILP enables secure, fast, and low-cost microtransactions across borders, establishing a decentralized standard for [online content monetization](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/creator-economy/).

The **Web Monetization API** builds on this foundation, offering a lightweight, open standard that allows creators to implement monetization with ease. Its goal is to make payments seamless for users and practical for creators, redefining the economics of digital content.

## Key Principles of Web Monetization

### 1. Web Monetization API

The **Web Monetization API** is a small piece of code embedded into web pages. It interacts with a user's browser or wallet to facilitate payments. When users with compatible wallets visit a monetized page, the API:

- Sends a payment request to a **[Payment Service Provider (PSP)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/p/payment-service-provider-psp/)**.

- Uses a **payment pointer** (a URI starting with "pay:") to identify the PSP and the recipient's account.

- Confirms the payment with the PSP and grants the user access to the content.

### 2. Payment Pointers

Payment pointers are unique web addresses that guide the PSP on where to send payments. They are integral to the API, simplifying transactions by eliminating the need for complex account details.

### 3. Microtransactions

Web Monetization enables tiny payments (fractions of a cent) for short-term or continuous content access.

### 4. Interledger Protocol

The ILP facilitates cross-platform payments, ensuring interoperability and scalability in global monetization.

## Analogy

Imagine going to a theme park where you pay for each ride as you go. Web Monetization acts as the payment system, and the API is like the ticket machineâ€”processing small amounts effortlessly.

## Practical Applications

### 1. Content Creation

Creators embed the API on their [websites](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/u/user-generated-content-ugc/), enabling users to make small payments for articles, videos, or art.

**Example:** A journalist offers premium articles for readers who pay a few cents via their browser.

### 2. Streaming Platforms

Musicians, filmmakers, and gamers can earn revenue per second of content consumed.

**Example:** An independent musician earns from every second their song is streamed on their website.

### 3. Education

Teachers and educational platforms can charge small fees for lessons, making quality education accessible.

**Example:** A math tutor uploads video tutorials and earns micro-payments as students watch.

### 4. Gaming

Web Monetization allows [gamers](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/g/gaming-payments/) to access premium levels or in-game items without upfront purchases or subscriptions.
