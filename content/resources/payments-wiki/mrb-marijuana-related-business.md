### Definition of Marijuana-Related Business (MRB)

A **Marijuana-Related Business (MRB)** refers to any entity involved in the legal cannabis industry, including cultivation, processing, distribution, retail dispensaries, and ancillary businesses that provide services such as legal, financial, or marketing support. These businesses operate within a complex regulatory landscape, navigating state laws while facing federal restrictions.

### Background / Backstory on MRBs

- The cannabis industry has seen exponential growth over the past decade, driven by increasing legalization in various states and countries.

- Despite legalization at the state level, cannabis remains federally illegal in many jurisdictions, complicating banking and payment options.

- The lack of clear federal guidance has resulted in MRBs being classified as high-risk businesses by financial institutions.

- The introduction of state-regulated cannabis programs has led to a surge in demand for compliant financial solutions.

### How MRBs Are Used in the Industry Today

- **Retail & Dispensaries**: Sell cannabis products to consumers for medicinal or recreational use.

- **Cultivation & Manufacturing**: Grow and process cannabis into various products like oils, edibles, and concentrates.

- **Ancillary Services**: Provide non-plant-touching services such as security, logistics, and financial consulting.

- **Financial Solutions**: Specialized banks, credit unions, and payment processors offer workarounds like closed-loop payment systems and cryptocurrency solutions.

### How MRBs Work in the Industry Today & Their Significance

- MRBs contribute to tax revenue and job creation, playing a crucial role in local economies.

- The industry's growth has led to increased demand for payment processing solutions, insurance, and financial management tools.

- Investment in cannabis-related fintech and blockchain-based solutions is rising to bridge the financial gap.

### How Does It Work? (With Two Examples)

- **Banking Challenges & Solutions**:

Traditional banks avoid MRBs due to federal restrictions.

- Some state-chartered banks and credit unions provide limited services under strict compliance programs.

- Example: A cannabis dispensary in Colorado partners with a credit union that offers vaulting services and state-compliant accounts.

- **Alternative Payment Methods**:

Many MRBs operate on a cash basis, leading to security risks.

- Some dispensaries adopt blockchain-based payment solutions to enable cashless transactions.

- Example: A dispensary uses stablecoins to facilitate digital payments while ensuring compliance with financial regulations.

### Simple Analogy for Understanding MRBs

Think of MRBs like food trucks in a city where credit card processors refuse to work with them. Since food trucks can't access traditional banking, they rely on cash or creative payment solutions like pre-paid accounts or digital wallets to stay in business.

### ELI5

Imagine you have a lemonade stand, but the bank won’t let you open an account because they don’t like lemonade. So, instead of using a normal bank, you find a special bank that only works with lemonade stands or use gift cards to accept money from customers.
