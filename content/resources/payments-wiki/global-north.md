## Background / Backstory on Global North

The division between the Global North and South emerged during the Cold War era, aligning with wealth disparities and industrialization levels. Historically, the Global North has benefited from colonialism, industrial revolutions, and globalization, securing its dominance in global trade, finance, and policymaking.
