### A Comprehensive Overview

#### Brief Overview

Web3 represents the next evolution of the internet, focusing on decentralized protocols and technologies. It aims to create a user-centric web, where users have control over their data, identity, and transactions, facilitated by blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and smart contracts.

#### Definition

Web3 is the third generation of the internet, utilizing blockchain technology, decentralized networks, and token-based economics to enable direct peer-to-peer interactions without the need for centralized intermediaries.

#### Layman's Definition

Think of Web3 as an internet where you, instead of companies, control your online data and transactions. It's like moving from renting online services to owning a piece of the internet yourself, with the help of technologies that ensure your ownership and transactions are secure and direct.

#### How Does It Work?

Web3 uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized online ecosystem. For example, in a Web3 social network, instead of a single company storing all user data on its servers, the data is distributed across a blockchain. This means your posts, identity, and connections are controlled by you through a cryptographic key, and interactions can involve cryptocurrencies for transactions or rewards.

#### Where It Is Used?

- [Decentralized finance](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/decentralized-finance-defi/) (DeFi) platforms

- Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)

- Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)

- [Decentralized applications](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/decentralized-applications-dapps/) (DApps) across various sectors

#### Why It Is Used?

- To promote data privacy and security

- To reduce reliance on centralized entities

- To enable true ownership of digital assets

- To foster innovation and new economic models

#### Who Uses It?

- [Cryptocurrency](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cryptocurrency/) enthusiasts and investors

- Developers building DApps

- Users seeking alternatives to traditional online services

- Businesses exploring blockchain for transparency and efficiency

#### Who Issues It?

Web3 itself isn't issued by anyone; it's a collective term for technologies and protocols developed by numerous organizations and open-source communities.

#### Who Regulates It?

Regulation is complex and varies by jurisdiction, focusing on specific aspects like cryptocurrencies (e.g., SEC in the USA for securities) rather than Web3 as a whole.

#### Top Usages

- Financial services without banks (DeFi)

- Buying and selling unique digital items (NFTs)

- Voting and governance in online communities ([DAOs](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao/))

#### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- Increased user control and ownership

- Enhanced privacy and security

- Opens up new economic and business models

**Cons:**

- Technical complexity and usability issues

- Regulatory uncertainty and legal challenges

- Potential for scams and financial risk

### Web3 Apps

Web3 applications, often referred to as decentralized applications (DApps), leverage blockchain technology to offer services that operate independently of central control. Here are some notable examples across different sectors:

#### 1. Finance: MakerDAO

- **What It Does:** MakerDAO is a decentralized finance (DeFi) application that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency without a central intermediary. It uses the Ethereum blockchain to manage its stablecoin, DAI, which is pegged to the US dollar.

- **How It Works:** Users can lock up collateral in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies to generate DAI. This process is managed through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security without the need for a traditional bank.

#### 2. Art and Collectibles: OpenSea

- **What It Does:** OpenSea is the largest [NFT](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/n/nft-non-fungible-tokens/) marketplace where users can buy, sell, and discover exclusive digital items and collectibles. It supports a wide range of NFTs, including art, domain names, virtual worlds, and more.

- **How It Works:** Artists and creators mint NFTs representing their digital works on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity and ownership. Buyers can purchase these NFTs through cryptocurrency transactions, directly connecting creators and collectors without an intermediary.

#### 3. Gaming: Axie Infinity

- **What It Does:** Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based game where players collect, breed, raise, battle, and trade token-based creatures known as Axies. It has its own economy, allowing players to earn cryptocurrency through gameplay.

- **How It Works:** Each Axie is an NFT with unique attributes and strengths. Players can earn the in-game currency, SLP (Smooth Love Potion), by playing the game, which can then be traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges.

#### 4. Social Media: Steemit

- **What It Does:** Steemit is a blockchain-based blogging and social media platform where users can earn rewards for posting, curating, and commenting content. It's built on the Steem blockchain.

- **How It Works:** Users receive STEEM tokens based on the engagement and upvotes their content receives from the community. This incentivizes quality content creation and active participation without central moderation.

#### 5. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Aragon

- **What It Does:** Aragon is a platform that enables users to create and manage DAOs, offering tools for decentralized decision-making and organization management.

- **How It Works:** Through Aragon, groups can deploy a customizable DAO on the Ethereum blockchain, where members can vote on decisions, manage resources, and govern collectively according to pre-defined rules encoded in smart contracts.

#### 6. Identity Verification: Civic

- **What It Does:** Civic is a secure identity platform that provides multi-factor authentication without a username, password, third party authenticator, or physical hardware token.

- **How It Works:** It uses blockchain technology to allow for secure and decentralized proof of identity. Users can safely store their identity data on their devices and share it with services that require verification, reducing the risk of identity theft.

These examples illustrate the diverse applications of Web3 technologies, showcasing how blockchain and decentralized systems can transform traditional online services by enhancing security, transparency, and user agency.

#### Examples of Usage

- **DeFi Platforms:** Users can lend or borrow cryptocurrencies, like lending 10 ETH on a platform to earn interest, without a bank.

- **NFT Marketplaces:** Artists sell digital art directly to consumers as NFTs, with one piece possibly selling for 50 ETH.

- **DAOs:** A group of individuals collectively manage a cryptocurrency fund, making investment decisions through democratic voting.

#### Also Known As

- Decentralized Web

- Blockchain Web

#### Real-world Analogy

If the traditional web is like living in a rented apartment (where the landlord controls the rules), Web3 is like owning your house (where you make the rules and directly benefit from improvements).
