## Definition

A **Mandated Market Maker (MMM)** is an entity or individual contractually obligated to provide continuous liquidity for a cryptocurrency asset by actively buying and selling tokens. Their primary role is to stabilize prices, reduce spreads, and ensure smooth trading on exchanges. Unlike voluntary market makers, MMMS operate under a formal agreement, typically with a project, exchange, or token issuer.

## Background / Backstory on Mandated Market Makers

Market makers have long been an essential part of traditional finance, ensuring liquidity in stock and forex markets. In crypto, market making became crucial due to high volatility, fragmented liquidity, and price manipulation risks. Many crypto projects, especially new tokens and [meme coins](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/m/meme-coins/), struggle with liquidity. This led to the rise of Mandated Market Makers (MMMs)—entities contractually bound to provide liquidity under predefined conditions to support price stability and trading efficiency.

### How is Mandated Market Maker (MMM) Used in the Industry Today?

Mandated Market Makers are widely used across:

- **Centralized Exchanges (CEXs):** Ensuring order book depth and reducing bid-ask spreads.

- **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs):** Providing liquidity through [automated market maker (AMM)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/automated-market-makers-amms/) pools.

- **New Token Launches:** Helping projects avoid price slippage and enhance price discovery.

- **Institutional Crypto Markets:** Enabling large-scale liquidity for institutional investors.

### How Does It Work? (With Examples)

An MMM operates by placing **limit buy and sell orders** within a set spread to maintain liquidity.

#### Example 1: Centralized Exchange Market Making

A new token, XYZCoin, lists on a centralized exchange. To avoid price manipulation and ensure liquidity:

- The project hires ABC Market Makers as its mandated liquidity provider.

- ABC agrees to keep $5 million in buy and sell orders at all times, adjusting based on trading volume.

- This prevents XYZCoin from experiencing large price swings due to sudden buy/sell pressure.

#### Example 2: DEX Liquidity Provision

On a **DeFi** platform like Uniswap, a project uses an MMM to provide liquidity:

- XYZCoin’s team deposits $1M worth of XYZ and $1M worth of USDT into a liquidity pool.

- The MMM monitors the pool, continuously adjusting weights to maintain the expected price range.

- This prevents [impermanent loss](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/i/impermanent-loss/) and keeps trading smooth for retail users.

### Simple Analogy for Understanding MMM

Think of an MMM like a **supermarket manager** ensuring shelves are always stocked. If customers buy too much milk, they quickly restock to prevent shortages. If too much milk is left unsold, they lower prices slightly to encourage purchases. Similarly, an MMM ensures a token always has buyers and sellers, preventing drastic price fluctuations.

### Stakeholders and Implementation

#### **Who Uses MMMs?**

- **Crypto Exchanges (CEX & DEX):** To improve trading efficiency.

- **Token Projects:** To ensure a smooth trading experience and avoid excessive volatility.

- **Liquidity Providers:** [Institutions that specialize in crypto market-making](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/l/liquidity-provider/).

#### Challenges in Implementation

- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Some jurisdictions see market making as a form of price manipulation.

- **Costly Operations:** Maintaining liquidity for volatile tokens requires significant capital.

- **Conflicts of Interest:** Some MMMs may exploit their position for profit rather than market health.

### Pros & Cons

| ****Pros**** | ****Cons**** |
| Reduces volatility & price manipulation | Can be expensive for token projects |
| Enhances order book depth & liquidity | Risk of collusion with exchanges |
| Facilitates better price discovery | Can create artificial demand |

## Future Outlook

With the rise of **DeFi**, MMMs are evolving beyond traditional market making:

- **AI-driven Market Makers:** Using algorithms for real-time liquidity adjustments.

- **Decentralized Market Making:** New protocols allowing anyone to contribute to liquidity provision.

- **Regulatory Oversight:** More compliance requirements for centralized MMMs.
