## Brief Overview

A Smart Contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, [decentralized blockchain network](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/blockchain/). They allow transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.

## Layman's Definition

Imagine a vending machine: When you select a snack, you enter your money, and the machine automatically gives you the item without needing a shopkeeper to oversee the transaction. Smart Contracts work similarly but in the digital world, automating agreements and transactions when certain conditions are met.

## How Do Smart Contracts Work?

Smart Contracts operate on a simple "if/when…then…" principle, which is coded into the blockchain. For example, if Person A transfers 10 Ether to Person B, then Person B's digital property is automatically transferred to Person A. The contract self-executes according to the predefined rules, and the transaction is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## Where It Is Used?

- Financial services (loans, insurance, payments)

- Supply chain management

- Real estate transactions

- Voting systems

- Legal processes

## Why Are Smart Contract Used?

They are used for automating and securing transactions in a trustless environment, reducing the need for intermediaries, lowering transaction costs, and increasing transaction speed and transparency.

## Who Uses It?

- Businesses for supply chain management and automatizing payments

- Individuals for buying or selling properties without intermediaries

- Governments for secure and transparent voting systems

- Developers in [decentralized applications (DApps)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/decentralized-applications-dapps/)

## Who Issues It?

Smart Contracts are not issued by any central authority. They are created by parties (usually developers) involved in the transaction or agreement.

## Who Regulates It?

Regulation varies by jurisdiction but generally falls under the broader regulatory framework governing blockchain and cryptocurrency transactions.

## On Which Blockchains Can Smart Contracts Work?

- Ethereum

- Binance Smart Chain

- Cardano

- Polkadot

- Tezos

## What Languages Are Smart Contracts Written in?

- Solidity (Ethereum)

- Vyper (Ethereum)

- Rust (Polkadot, Solana)

- Haskell (Cardano)

## Top Usage

- Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications

- Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs)

- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- Eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing costs

- Transactions are transparent, secure, and tamper-proof

- Automates and speeds up transactions

**Cons:**

- Code vulnerabilities can lead to hacks or losses

- Legal status and regulation can be unclear

- Can be complex to create and understand for non-developers

## Examples of Usage

- **DeFi Platforms:** Platforms like Uniswap use Smart Contracts to facilitate cryptocurrency trading without a central exchange, handling billions of dollars in transactions.

- **NFT Marketplaces:** Marketplaces like OpenSea use Smart Contracts to ensure the unique ownership and transferability of digital assets.

- **Supply Chain Management:** Companies use Smart Contracts to automate and securely document the supply chain process, ensuring the authenticity and traceability of products.

## Examples of Real-World Smart Contracts

Here are five examples of typical Smart Contracts and their functionalities across various sectors:

#### **Crowdfunding:**

- **What they do:** These contracts automate the fundraising process for projects or startups. Investors send cryptocurrency to the smart contract, which holds the funds until a certain goal is reached. If the goal is met by the deadline, the contract automatically releases the funds to the project creators. If the goal is not met, the funds are returned to the investors.

- **Example scenario:** A startup wants to raise 100 Ether for a new project. They set up a contract with a 60-day deadline. The contract collects funds from investors and, if 100 Ether is raised within 60 days, transfers the funds to the startup. Otherwise, it refunds the investors.

#### **Insurance Smart Contracts:**

- **What they do:** These contracts are used to automate the insurance claim process. The contract is programmed with conditions under which a claim can be made. When those conditions are met (e.g., flight delay, natural disaster), the contract automatically processes the claim and issues the payment to the insured party.

- **Example scenario:** Travel insurance that pays out if a flight is delayed more than 3 hours. The contract is connected to flight data. If a registered flight is delayed beyond the threshold, the contract automatically compensates the insured travelers.

#### **Supply Chain Tracking Smart Contracts:**

- **What they do:** These contracts track the movement and custody of goods in a supply chain. Each time a product changes hands, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain. This provides a transparent, immutable record from manufacture to sale, ensuring authenticity and compliance.

- **Example scenario:** A luxury handbag manufacturer uses these to track each bag from the leather supplier to the retail buyer. Each step in the process (manufacture, shipping, delivery) is recorded, ensuring the bag's authenticity and ethical sourcing.

#### **Real Estate Transaction Smart Contracts:**

- **What they do:** Automate the buying and selling of property. These contracts can hold property titles and automatically transfer them to the buyer upon receipt of payment, eliminating the need for traditional escrow services.

- **Example scenario:** A buyer wants to purchase a house. Once the Smart Contract receives payment from the buyer, it automatically transfers the property title to them, records the transaction on the blockchain, and releases the funds to the seller, streamlining the entire process.

#### **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) Smart Contracts:**

- **What they do:** DAOs are fully automated, decentralized organizations governed by Smart Contracts. These contracts lay out the rules of the organization and execute decisions based on member votes, without human intervention.

- **Example scenario:** A decentralized venture capital fund where investment decisions are made through member voting. Each member's voting power is proportional to their token holdings in the DAO. When a decision reaches a predetermined majority, the contract automatically allocates funds to the agreed-upon investments.

These examples illustrate the versatility and efficiency of these contracts in automating and securing transactions across various industries, from finance and insurance to supply chain management and governance.

### Also Known As

- Blockchain Contracts

- Digital Contracts

- Self-executing Contracts

### Real-world Analogy

If a traditional contract is a written agreement, a Smart Contract is a vending machine. Just as a vending machine automatically executes a transaction based on the input (money) and selection (snack), a Smart Contract automatically executes the terms of an agreement when predetermined conditions are met.
