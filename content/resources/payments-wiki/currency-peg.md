## Definition

A **currency peg** is a [policy](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/m/monetary-policy/) where a country maintains its currency's value at a fixed exchange rate to a foreign currency or a basket of currencies. This is achieved by the central bank which actively buys and sells its own currency in the foreign exchange market to maintain the pegged rate.

## Usage Context

In the banking and financial industry, they are used for several purposes:

- **Stabilizing a currency:** Especially in countries with less stable economies, [pegging](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/p/peg/) can help stabilize their currency by tying it to a more stable and widely accepted currency.

- **Facilitating trade and investments:** A pegged currency reduces the uncertainty in international transactions, encouraging trade and foreign investments.

- **Inflation control:** It can help limit inflation in a country by tying the currency to a more stable economy's currency.

## Importance

Pegged currencies are significant because they:

- **Provide predictability** in international trade and investment.

- **Enhance credibility** of the currency in global markets.

- **Control inflation** by aligning with the monetary policy of the pegged [currency](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/currency/), usually a stronger one.

## Users

- **Central Banks:** They are the primary entities that implement and manage currency pegs.

- **Governments:** Involved in decision-making and policy setting.

- **Traders and Investors:** They engage in international trade and investments.

- **Businesses and Consumers:** Affected by exchange rate stability in their transactions.

## Application

- **Intervention in Forex Markets:** Central banks buy or sell large amounts of their own currency.

- **Reserve Management:** Holding reserves of the foreign currency to which their currency is pegged.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros**

- **Stability:** Reduces exchange rate volatility.

- **Predictability:** Eases planning for businesses and investors.

**Cons**

- **Saudi Arabia:** Pegs its currency to the US Dollar, crucial for an oil-exporting country with revenues primarily in dollars.

- **Denmark:** Pegs its currency to the Euro, facilitating trade and economic relations with the Eurozone.

## Analogies

Imagine it like a tethered balloon. The balloon (domestic currency) is tied to a solid object (foreign currency or basket of currencies). Just as the balloon's movement is restricted and stabilized by the tether, the currency's value is stabilized by the peg, preventing drastic fluctuations.
