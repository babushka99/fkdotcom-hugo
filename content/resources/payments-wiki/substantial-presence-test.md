The Substantial Presence Test is a criterion used primarily by the United States to determine the [tax residency](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/t/tax-residency/) status of an individual, particularly for foreign nationals. Unlike the more straightforward 183-day rule, the Substantial Presence Test involves a more complex calculation, taking into account the individual's presence in the U.S. over a three-year period.

## How It Is Calculated

- **Current Year**: Count all the days the individual was present in the U.S. in the current year.

- **First Preceding Year**: Count one-third of the days the individual was present in the U.S. in the first year before the current year.

- **Second Preceding Year**: Count one-sixth of the days the individual was present in the U.S. in the second year before the current year.

The sum of these days across the three-year period determines if the individual meets the substantial presence criteria.

## Criteria for Passing the Test

- An individual passes the test and is considered a resident alien for [tax](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/t/taxes/) purposes if they are present in the U.S. for:

- At least 31 days during the current year, and

- 183 days during the three-year period that includes the current year and the two years immediately before that, following the formula mentioned above.

## Implications

- If an individual passes the Substantial Presence Test, they are considered a resident alien for tax purposes in the U.S. and are required to report worldwide income to the IRS, similar to a U.S. citizen.

- It is important for individuals who split their time between the U.S. and other countries to be aware of this test to understand their U.S. tax obligations.

## Exceptions and Nuances

- There are exceptions to this rule. For example, days present in the U.S. as a diplomat, teacher, student, or professional athlete temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event are usually exempt.

- The IRS also provides a "Closer Connection Exception" for individuals who were physically present in the U.S. for less than [183 days](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/0-9/183-days-tax-rule/) in the current year, have a tax home in another country during the year, and maintain a closer connection to that country than to the U.S.

## Importance

- The Substantial Presence Test is crucial for international individuals who spend significant time in the U.S. to determine their tax residency status, which impacts their tax liabilities.

For more detailed information, consulting a tax professional or the [IRS guidelines](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test) on the Substantial Presence Test is recommended, as it can be complex and has significant implications for an individual's tax obligations.

The Substantial Presence Test is a specific tax residency criterion primarily used by the United States. Its detailed approach of counting the days of physical presence in the U.S. over a three-year period, with a particular weighting formula, is unique to U.S. tax law.

In other countries, tax residency is typically determined by different criteria. While the concept of counting days of presence in a country is common in determining tax residency, the specific method of the Substantial Presence Test, with its distinct three-year calculation, is not generally used outside the United States.

Other jurisdictions might use simpler day-count tests like the 183-day rule, or they may base tax residency on other factors such as domicile, permanent home, or the center of economic interests. Each country has its own set of rules and criteria for determining tax residency, reflecting its tax laws and policies.

For anyone dealing with international tax issues, it's important to understand the specific rules of each country in which they have a presence. The rules can vary widely and have significant implications for an individual's or entity's tax obligations. In the case of the U.S., the IRS provides detailed guidelines on the Substantial Presence Test, and similar authoritative sources would be available for other countries' residency tests.
