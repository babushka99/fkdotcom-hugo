## Definition

**21 Million Bitcoins** refers to the maximum supply limit of Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. This cap is hardcoded into Bitcoin's protocol, ensuring scarcity and mimicking the properties of precious resources like gold.

### Background / Backstory on 21 Million Bitcoins

Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous person (or group) known as [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/s/satoshi-nakamoto/). The 21 million cap was designed to prevent inflation and ensure long-term value. Unlike traditional money, which can be printed endlessly, Bitcoin's finite supply makes it a deflationary asset. This scarcity is enforced by the blockchain, a decentralized ledger that tracks every Bitcoin transaction.

### How is 21 Million Bitcoins Used in the Industry Today?

The 21 million Bitcoin limit is central to cryptocurrency's value proposition. Here’s how it’s significant: Store of Value: Bitcoin is often called "digital gold" because its scarcity makes it a hedge against inflation. [Decentralized Finance (DeFi)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/decentralized-finance-defi/): Bitcoin is used as collateral in DeFi platforms, enabling lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries. Layer 1 Blockchain: Bitcoin operates as a Layer 1 blockchain, meaning it’s the foundational network where transactions are recorded. 
**How It Works**: **Mining**: New Bitcoins are created through mining, a process where computers solve complex math problems to validate transactions. **Halving**: Every 210,000 blocks (about 4 years), the reward for mining is halved, slowing down the creation of new Bitcoins until the 21 million cap is reached. 
**Examples**: **Institutional Adoption**: Companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset, betting on its scarcity-driven value. **DeFi Integration**: Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) allows Bitcoin to be used on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms, expanding its utility.

### Simple Analogy

Think of Bitcoin like a rare collectible, such as a limited-edition trading card. Only 21 million cards exist, and no more can ever be made. As more people want the card, its value increases because there’s only a fixed number available. This scarcity makes it valuable, just like [Bitcoin](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/bitcoin/).

### Stakeholders and Implementation

### Who Uses 21 Million Bitcoins

**Investors**: Individuals and institutions buying Bitcoin as an investment. **Miners**: Participants who validate transactions and earn Bitcoin rewards. **Developers**: Teams building tools and platforms around Bitcoin. 
**Merchants**: Businesses accepting Bitcoin as payment.
