Ethereum Request for Comment 20, commonly known as ERC20, is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/e/ethereum-blockchain/) for implementing tokens. These tokens are blockchain-based assets that have value and can be sent and received. The standard defines a set of rules that apply to all ERC20 tokens, ensuring compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Where It Is Used

ERC20 tokens are primarily used on the Ethereum blockchain. They facilitate transactions involving digital assets and are used to create and issue smart contract-based tokens.

### Why It Is Used

The ERC20 standard is used to ensure consistency and interoperability among tokens within the Ethereum blockchain. It simplifies the process of creating new tokens by providing a blueprint that developers can follow, making token integration easier for wallets, exchanges, and other smart contracts.

### Who Uses It

- Developers creating new tokens or digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain.

- Investors and traders dealing with a variety of tokens.

- Cryptocurrency exchanges that list multiple tokens for trading.

- [Decentralized applications (DApps)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/decentralized-applications-dapps/) that require tokens for their ecosystems.

### Who Issues It

Individual developers or organizations can issue ERC20 tokens by deploying a smart contract that adheres to the ERC20 standard on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Who Regulates It

There is no central regulatory body for ERC20 tokens. However, the deployment and interaction with these tokens are governed by the immutable rules of the Ethereum blockchain. Regulatory compliance for specific uses of ERC20 tokens (e.g., in ICOs or token sales) falls under the jurisdiction of local financial regulatory bodies.

### Top Usage

- **Utility Tokens:** Access to a specific blockchain-based service or platform.

- **Governance Tokens:** Voting rights within decentralized projects or DAOs.

- **Stablecoins:** Cryptocurrencies pegged to real-world assets like USD to reduce volatility.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- **Standardization:** Facilitates interoperability among different applications and services on Ethereum.

- **Accessibility:** Lowers the barrier for developers to create and issue tokens.

- **Flexibility:** Supports a wide range of applications, from simple transfers to complex DApp interactions.

**Cons:**

- **Scalability Issues:** High demand can lead to network congestion and increased transaction fees.

- **Security Risks:** Poorly written smart contracts can be exploited.

- **Regulatory Uncertainty:** The legal status and compliance requirements can be unclear, varying by jurisdiction.

### Examples of Usage

- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Platforms:** Using ERC20 tokens for lending, borrowing, or earning interest.

- **Token Sales and ICOs:** Projects raise funds by issuing ERC20 tokens as a form of investment.

- **Digital Identity Systems:** Using tokens to represent identity or access rights within a network.

### Real-world Analogy

Consider ERC20 tokens as "event tickets" within the Ethereum "stadium." Each ticket (token) follows a standard format (ERC20), ensuring that they can be used across various events (DApps) within the stadium, from concerts ([DeFi ](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/decentralized-finance-defi/)platforms) to sports games (governance in DAOs).
