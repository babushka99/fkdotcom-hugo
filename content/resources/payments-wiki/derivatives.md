### Definition and Origin

**Derivatives** are financial contracts whose value is derived from the performance of underlying assets, indices, or interest rates. Common underlying assets include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indexes. They can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamia around 1750 BC, where farmers used forward contracts to hedge against crop failures. In the modern era, derivatives gained prominence with the establishment of organized exchanges like the Chicago Board of Trade in 1848 and have since evolved to include complex financial instruments traded globally.
