## Definition

A **confidence scam** (or con) is a type of **fraud** in which a perpetrator **gains the trust** of a victim to manipulate them into handing over money, assets, or sensitive information. The scam hinges on deception, persuasion, and psychological manipulation rather than force or coercion.

### Background / Backstory on Confidence Scams

Confidence scams have existed for centuries, evolving with technology and financial systems. From classic** **Ponzi schemes in the 1920s to modern-day crypto rug pulls, scammers exploit human emotions—greed, fear, and the desire to belong—to extract value. With the rise of digital finance, online transactions, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), confidence scams have become more sophisticated, taking new forms such as fake [Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/i/initial-coin-offering-ico/) and elaborate crypto pump-and-dump schemes.

### How Does a Confidence Scam Work?

At its core, a confidence scam follows a **structured psychological process**:

- **Building Trust** – The scammer presents themselves as credible, often posing as a professional, investment guru, or even a friend.

- **Creating Urgency or FOMO** – Victims are pressured to act quickly, fearing they might miss out on an exclusive opportunity.

- **Manipulating the Victim** – False promises of high returns, fake testimonials, and manipulated data create the illusion of legitimacy.

- **The Take** – The scammer convinces the victim to transfer funds or provide private credentials.

- **Exit Strategy** – Once the money is secured, the scammer disappears, leaving the victim with no recourse.

#### Example 1: Crypto Ponzi Scheme

A fraudster launches a DeFi investment platform, promising 200% returns in 60 days. Early investors are paid using new investors' funds. As momentum builds, more people invest. The scammer eventually vanishes with the majority of funds, collapsing the scheme.

#### Example 2: Fake Tech Support Scam

A victim receives a warning pop-up on their computer claiming a security breach. A fake "tech support agent" guides them to transfer Bitcoin or [gift cards](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/p/prepaid-gift-card/) to "fix" the issue—only for the victim to later realize no real problem existed.

### Who is the Target Audience?

Confidence scams target a wide range of victims, including:

- **Retail investors** looking for high returns in crypto or forex.

- **Elderly individuals** unfamiliar with digital transactions.

- **New entrepreneurs** seeking funding or business partnerships.

- **DeFi users** who lack technical knowledge and security awareness.

### Why Do People Fall for Confidence Scams?

Victims fall prey due to:

- **Social Engineering**: Scammers manipulate emotions like trust, greed, and urgency.

- **Lack of Financial Literacy**: Many individuals do not recognize red flags.

- **Psychological Biases**: People tend to trust authority figures and group consensus, making them vulnerable.

- **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**: In speculative markets like crypto and NFTs, [urgency often overrides caution](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/fomo-fear-of-missing-out/).

### How Common Are Confidence Scams?

- **In 2023**, global [crypto](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cryptocurrency/) scams exceeded **$14 billion**, with confidence scams among the most reported fraud types.
