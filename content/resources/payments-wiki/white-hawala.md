## **TL;DR:**

White Hawala refers to undocumented financial transactions where the source and use of funds are entirely legitimate, with no involvement of illegal or laundered money. Although these transactions bypass the central banking system, they are legal in essence since both origin and destination funds are lawful.

## **Executive Summary:**

White Hawala is a type of undocumented transaction in which funds are transferred across borders without passing through the official financial channels overseen by central banks. Despite not being recorded in the formal financial system, the origin, and use of the funds in a white Hawala transaction are completely legitimate, coming from lawful sources and used for legal purposes. White Hawala plays a role in various scenarios, such as migrant remittances, where formal banking channels may be costly or unavailable, and individuals use these networks to send money efficiently. The absence of central bank oversight makes the transaction undocumented, but the money itself remains “white” or legal.

The term ‘White Hawala’ was coined by [Faisal Khan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faisalkhan99/), CEO of Faisal Khan LLC, to differentiate lawful undocumented transactions from those [involving illicit funds](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/payments-wiki/hawala-transfer/).

## **White Hawala: A Detailed Overview**

### **Definition and Concept**

White Hawala refers to undocumented financial transactions that involve legitimate money transfers outside of formal banking channels. The central feature of a white Hawala is that the funds, from their origin to their final destination, are lawful and not derived from criminal activities. These transactions occur without being recorded in the formal books of a central bank, making them invisible to national financial authorities.

In white Hawala, the focus is on the legitimacy of the funds involved, even though the mechanism bypasses conventional financial institutions. While the system remains technically undocumented, the money is legal, creating a grey area between legality and regulatory compliance.

### **How White Hawala Works**

- **Sender’s Side:** A person in one country gives a legitimate sum of money to a Hawala broker (or Hawaladar).

- **Transfer Process:** The broker contacts another [Hawaladar](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/h/hawala-transfer/) in the recipient’s country, instructing them to pay the equivalent amount to the intended recipient.

- **Recipient’s Side:** The recipient collects the money in the destination country, usually in cash or through local arrangements.

No official records are kept, and the central bank cannot detect these inflows or outflows. However, as long as the funds on both ends are legal and traceable, the transaction can be classified as a white Hawala.

### **Advantages and Use Cases**

- **Migrant Remittances:** Workers abroad often use white Hawala networks to [send money back to their families](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/h/home-remittances/) quickly and cost-effectively.

- **Cross-Border Trade:** Some traders rely on these networks to settle accounts when banking systems are inaccessible or too slow.

### **Risks and Disadvantages**

- **Regulatory Concerns:** Although legal, these transactions evade regulatory oversight.

- **Lack of Transparency:** Authorities cannot track the volume or destination of these transactions, raising compliance concerns.

### **Example of White Hawala**

- **Migrant Worker Remittance:** [A migrant worker](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/m/migrant-workers/) in Saudi Arabia sends $1,000 to his family in Pakistan through a Hawaladar. The money is from his legal salary, and his family receives the full amount in local currency without fees.

- **Business Transaction:** A small business owner in Dubai pays for goods purchased from a supplier in India via a white Hawala network. Both parties have declared the income legally, but the transaction avoids [high international banking fees](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/t/transaction-fee/).

### **Conclusion**

White Hawala exemplifies how informal money transfer systems can meet legitimate financial needs without involving the formal banking sector. It operates entirely on lawful funds, ensuring that the origin and destination of money are both legal, even though these transactions remain undocumented. White Hawala highlights the value of trust-based financial networks, especially in regions with limited access to formal banking or where regulatory frameworks can be burdensome. However, despite its legitimate purpose, the lack of oversight still presents challenges, such as transparency and regulatory compliance. Striking a balance between flexibility and transparency can help ensure that this method of money transfer continues to serve as a useful financial tool while minimizing risks.
