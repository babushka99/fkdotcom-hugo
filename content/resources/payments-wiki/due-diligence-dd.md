## Brief Definition and Origin

**Due Diligence (DD)** is the process of conducting a comprehensive investigation or audit of a business, financial operation, or individual before entering into an agreement or transaction. It is designed to assess risks, ensure [regulatory compliance](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/aml-law/), and verify financial and legal standings.

The concept of Due Diligence originated from the **U.S. Securities Act of 1933**, which mandated that brokers and dealers fully disclose material information about securities before they were sold to investors. Over time, the practice has evolved into a critical component of risk management across various industries, particularly in **banking, finance, corporate transactions, and international trade**.

## Current Usage and Importance

In today’s financial ecosystem, **Due Diligence is fundamental to ensuring transparency, risk mitigation, and regulatory compliance**. It plays a key role in multiple sectors, including:
