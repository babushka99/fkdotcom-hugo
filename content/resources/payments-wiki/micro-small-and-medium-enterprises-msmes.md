MSME stands for "Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises." This term is used globally to classify businesses based on their size, usually in terms of the number of employees, total assets, or revenue.

The official definition of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) can vary from country to country, as different nations may have different criteria for classifying businesses as micro, small, or medium enterprises. Generally, these categories are defined as follows:

- **Micro Enterprises**: These are the smallest businesses, often characterized by a very small workforce (for example, 10 employees or fewer) and a relatively low level of revenue or assets. Examples include small retail shops, home-based businesses, and solo entrepreneurs.

- **Small Enterprises**: These businesses are larger than micro enterprises but still relatively small in terms of their market reach and financial capabilities. They might employ between 10 to 50 employees and have a higher revenue or asset level than micro enterprises. Examples include small manufacturing units, IT service companies, and small-scale restaurants.

- **Medium Enterprises**: These are larger than small enterprises and have more significant market presence and financial resources. They may employ up to a few hundred people and have a substantial amount of revenue and assets. Examples include medium-sized manufacturing plants, large restaurants, or regional service providers.
