A **51% attack** refers to a situation in which a single entity or group gains control of more than half of the computing power (hashrate) on a blockchain network. This level of control can potentially allow the entity to manipulate the blockchain in various harmful ways, such as double spending coins, preventing new transactions from being confirmed, or altering the ordering of transactions. It's a significant security concern in the realm of decentralized cryptocurrencies.

### Where It Is Used

Primarily, the concept of a 51% attack is relevant in the context of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies that utilize [Proof of Work (PoW)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/p/proof-of-work-pow/) for consensus on the network.

### Why 51% attack Is Used

Such an attack is not used for any legitimate purpose by design; instead, it represents a vulnerability. Attackers may pursue it for financial gain (e.g., double spending) or to damage a network's credibility.

### Who Uses It

This kind of attack would be executed by miners or groups of miners who have amassed enough computational power to control over 50% of the network's mining hashrate.

### Who Issues 51% attack 

The concept of a 51% attack is inherent to the structure of blockchain technology itself and is not "issued" by any entity. It is a potential risk arising from the decentralized and competitive nature of mining in blockchain networks.

### Who Regulates It

There is no centralized authority that regulates or prevents 51% attacks. However, blockchain networks may implement various technical measures to increase their resistance to such attacks.

### Top Usage 

The primary risk of a 51% attack includes:

- Double spending: Reversing transactions to allow the same cryptocurrency to be spent more than once.

- Censorship of transactions: Preventing specific transactions from being confirmed.

- Blockchain reorganization: Rearranging the order of transactions.

## Pros and Cons of 51% attack

## Pros:

- Theoretical considerations of a 51% attack help in designing more robust and secure blockchain networks.

### Cons:

- Threat to decentralization and security: Centralizing control in the hands of a few undermines the blockchain's integrity.

- Loss of trust: Successful attacks can diminish confidence in the affected cryptocurrency.

- Potential financial losses: Users and exchanges may suffer financial losses due to double spending or transaction reversal.

### Examples of Usage 

- **Bitcoin Gold Attack (2018):** Bitcoin Gold experienced a 51% attack where attackers were able to double spend approximately $18 million worth of Bitcoin Gold.

- **Ethereum Classic Attack (2019):** Ethereum Classic suffered multiple 51% attacks, leading to significant double spending and loss of trust in the network.

### Also Known As

- Majority attack

- Double spend attack

### Real-world Analogy of 51% attack

It can be likened to a scenario where over half of the voting members in a democratic election collude to control the outcome, undermining the fairness and integrity of the election process.
