These include major brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. They establish the rules, standards, and technical specifications for card transactions, ensuring security, interoperability, and compliance across the global payments ecosystem.

## Usage Context

Card schemes are used in a wide array of financial transactions, ranging from in-store purchases to online payments, and from [ATM](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/automated-teller-machine-atm/) withdrawals to money transfers. They enable seamless, cross-border, and multi-currency transactions, playing a crucial role in the global economy by facilitating trade and consumer spending.

Card schemes are vital for the efficiency and security of the global payments system. They provide the infrastructure that allows for instant payments and settlements, enhance consumer protection through [fraud detection systems](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/fraud-management-systems/), and enable financial inclusion by connecting underserved populations to the formal economy.
