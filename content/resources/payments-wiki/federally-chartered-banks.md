A federally chartered bank in the United States is a financial institution that has obtained its charter from the federal government, specifically the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), rather than a state government. This means the bank operates under federal laws and is subject to oversight from federal regulators. Note that I'm unable to provide URLs in my responses, but you can visit the official website of the OCC for more detailed and updated information.

### Federal Aspect

What makes a bank “federal” is its adherence to, and regulation under, national (federal) laws and oversight as opposed to state laws. A federal bank's charter is issued by the OCC, which is a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. This body is responsible for chartering, regulating, and supervising all national banks and federal savings associations. The OCC plays a vital role in ensuring that these institutions operate in a safe and sound manner and offer fair access and fair treatment to their customers.

### Regulatory Bodies

Although the OCC is the primary regulator for federally chartered banks, multiple agencies might be involved in regulation and oversight, depending on the bank's activities and structure. Some of these include:

- **Federal Reserve System (Fed):** Especially for those banks that are members of the [Federal Reserve](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/federal-reserve-system/), the Fed plays a key role in regulation and also handles matters related to monetary policy.

- **Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC):** It ensures deposits in banks and thrifts for at least $250,000 and plays a role in regulating and supervising state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System.

### Advantages of Federal Charter

- **Interstate Banking:** It can often more easily operate in multiple states without the need to adhere to varying state banking laws.

- **Uniform Regulations:** Operating under a single, national set of regulations can provide consistency and may simplify compliance in some respects.

- **Global Operations:** A federal charter may facilitate the international operations of a bank by providing a cohesive regulatory framework that is recognized globally.

- **Prestige:** There’s sometimes a perception of added legitimacy and stability with federal chartering due to the stringent requirements and comprehensive oversight provided by the OCC.

### Examples of Federally Chartered Banks

While the exact status of banks can change and should be verified for the most up-to-date information, some well-known federally chartered banks have included:

- **JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.:** "N.A." stands for "National Association" and indicates a federal charter.

- **Bank of America, N.A.:** Another example of a large, nationally chartered bank.

- **Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.:** This bank also operates under a federal charter.

In summary, they are integral elements in the U.S. financial system, navigating their operations under the umbrella of federal regulations and oversight, and often operating with a scope that extends beyond state and sometimes national borders. These institutions contribute to the financial stability, efficiency, and integrity of the U.S. economic and financial infrastructure, adhering to a regulatory framework designed to safeguard both the banks and their customers.

Always consider visiting the OCC, [FDIC](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/what-does-the-federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-fdic-do/), and Federal Reserve official websites for the most accurate and current information regarding federally chartered banks and their regulations. Remember to verify the charter status of a bank through these official channels for the most reliable information.
