### Definition and Origin

Central Banks, pivotal institutions in the financial sector, oversee a nation's [monetary policy](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/m/monetary-policy/) and regulate its currency and money supply. Originating in Sweden with the Riksbank in the 17th century, the concept has evolved, significantly impacting global economics. The Bank of England, established in 1694, set a precedent for modern central banking practices. Over time, central banks have adapted, taking on roles such as financial stability oversight and serving as lenders of last resort.

With the advent of [digital banking](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/digital-bank/), cryptocurrencies, and global financial crises, their role has further expanded to include stringent regulatory oversight and participation in international financial governance.
