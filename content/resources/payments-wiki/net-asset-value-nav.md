## Definition of Net Asset Value (NAV)

Net Asset Value (NAV) is a financial metric that represents the total value of an entity’s assets minus its liabilities. It is primarily used to determine the per-share value of mutual funds, [ETFs](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/e/exchange-traded-funds-etf/), and investment portfolios. NAV is commonly expressed as:

**NAV = (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) / Number of Outstanding Shares**

## Formula to Calculate NAV

The formula for calculating NAV is:

NAV=Total Assets−Total Liabilities Number of Outstanding Shares\text{NAV} = \frac{\text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Number of Outstanding Shares}}

Where:

- **Total Assets** include [cash](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cash-management/), securities, receivables, and other investments.

- **Total Liabilities** include debts, expenses, and any other financial obligations.

- **Number of Outstanding Shares** refers to the total shares issued by the fund.

## Background / Backstory on Net Asset Value (NAV)

NAV emerged as a fundamental valuation method in the investment industry, particularly within mutual funds and ETFs. Historically, it provided investors with a transparent and standardized way to measure the worth of their investments. With advancements in [financial technology](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/fintech/), NAV calculations have evolved to support real-time reporting, automated rebalancing, and compliance requirements in banking and investment services.

## How Net Asset Value (NAV) is Used in the Industry Today

NAV is widely used across various financial sectors:

- **Investment Funds**: Mutual funds, ETFs, and hedge funds rely on NAV to determine share prices.

- **Wealth Management**: Portfolio managers use NAV to assess investment performance.

- **Banking & Payments**: NAV plays a role in managing assets, liabilities, and [liquidity](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/l/liquidity/) for banks.

- **Cross-border Services**: Helps in valuing FX reserves and investment funds in international finance.

- **Digital Banking & Fintech**: NAV is integrated into robo-advisors and automated portfolio management tools.

## How Does It Work? (Detailed Examples)

### Example 1: Mutual Fund Pricing

A mutual fund has:

- **Total Assets**: $100 million

- **Total Liabilities**: $5 million

- **Outstanding Shares**: 10 million

NAV per share = ($100M - $5M) / 10M = $9.50 per share This means investors buying or selling fund shares will transact at $9.50 per share.

### Example 2: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

An ETF holds:

- **Total Stock & Bond Holdings**: $500 million

- **Liabilities (Management Fees, Other Expenses)**: $20 million

- **Outstanding Shares**: 50 million

NAV per share = ($500M - $20M) / 50M = $9.60 per share This value helps investors gauge whether the ETF is trading at a premium or discount in the market.

## Simple Analogy to Understand NAV

Think of NAV like the value of a pizza. If you own a pizza worth $20 and have $2 in delivery fees (liabilities), the remaining value is $18. If you cut the pizza into 6 equal slices, each slice (or share) is worth $3. This is how NAV works in funds and investments.

## ELI5

Imagine you have a piggy bank with $10 in coins and owe your friend $2. Your actual money after paying your friend is $8. If you split it between four friends, each gets $2. That’s NAV—what’s left after paying debts divided among owners.
