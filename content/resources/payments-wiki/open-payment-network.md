## Background / Backstory 
The rise of digital payments has reshaped the traditional financial landscape, giving birth to innovative models like open payment network. As traditional payment methods such as [cash](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cash/) and [cards](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/card-networks/) evolved, the demand for diverse, convenient, and secure transaction methods grew.
