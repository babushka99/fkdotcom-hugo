### Advances to Deposit Ratio (ADR) in the Financial Sector

#### Definition

**Advances to Deposit Ratio (ADR)** is a financial metric used by banks to assess the proportion of funds loaned out as advances or loans against the total amount of deposits received. It is calculated by dividing the total advances granted by the bank by the total deposits it holds, usually expressed as a percentage.

- **Liquidity Management:** To ensure banks have adequate [liquidity ](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/l/liquidity/)and are not overextending their loan portfolios.

#### Analogies

Think of ADR in banking like the water level in a reservoir compared to its capacity. Just as a reservoir must balance between having enough water for supply (loans) and not exceeding its capacity (deposits) to avoid overflows or shortages, a bank must balance its loan issuance with its deposit base to maintain financial stability and liquidity.
