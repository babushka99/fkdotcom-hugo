Escrow in Banking & Payments is a financial arrangement where a third party holds and regulates the payment of funds required for two parties involved in a given transaction. It helps make transactions more secure by keeping the payment in a secure escrow account which is only released when all the terms of an agreement are met, as overseen by the escrow company.

## How Escrow Works in Banking & Payments

- **Parties Involved:** Typically, there are three parties involved in an escrow arrangement: the buyer, the seller, and the escrow agent. The escrow agent is usually a neutral third party.

- **Purpose:** The primary purpose is to add a layer of security for both parties in the transaction. It protects the buyer from the risk of the seller not delivering the promised goods or services, and the seller from the risk of non-payment.

- **Process:**

- The buyer and seller agree on the terms and details of the transaction.

- The buyer deposits the payment into the escrow account.

- The seller delivers the goods or services.

- Once the buyer is satisfied with the goods or services, the escrow releases the payment to the seller.

## Where It's Used Most

- Real estate transactions.

- Online marketplaces.

- Intellectual property transactions.

- Mergers and acquisitions.
