## **Definition of Banksplaining**

Banksplaining is a term used to describe when [banking](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/banking/) professionals explain financial concepts in an unnecessarily complex, jargon-heavy, or condescending way. It often affects individuals who lack financial expertise, making it difficult for them to make informed decisions.

This phenomenon is prevalent across various banking sectors, from retail and commercial banking to investment and asset management. By using technical terms or overcomplicating simple financial matters, banks may unintentionally—or sometimes intentionally—create confusion, leading to diminished trust and engagement from customers and regulators.

## **Background / Backstory on Banksplaining**

The term "banksplaining" is derived from the broader concept of "mansplaining" and has been adapted to the banking industry. Historically, [financial institutions](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/financial-institution-fi/) have used complex language to maintain an air of authority, exclusivity, and control over financial knowledge. This has contributed to a lack of transparency and financial literacy among the general public.

With customers demanding greater clarity and understanding, financial institutions are now being pushed to adopt more transparent communication strategies to build trust and improve customer experiences.

## **How Banksplaining is Used in the Industry Today**

Banksplaining is prevalent in various banking sectors, often creating unnecessary barriers between financial institutions and their customers. Whether in retail banking, wealth management, or regulatory compliance, professionals may use complex terminology that makes financial products or services seem more intricate than they actually are.

This often leads to customer frustration, poor decision-making, and a general lack of trust in banking institutions. By making financial language more accessible, banks can enhance consumer confidence and financial literacy.

- **Retail Banking:** Used to explain [interest rates](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/i/interest/interest-rates/), loan terms, and savings accounts, often making it difficult for customers to compare options.

- **Commercial Banking:** Can obscure lending conditions, risk assessments, and compliance requirements for businesses.

## **How Banksplaining Works (Examples)**

Banksplaining typically occurs when financial professionals overcomplicate explanations, leading customers or stakeholders to feel confused or overwhelmed. This often results in a lack of transparency and difficulty in making well-informed financial decisions.

The following examples illustrate common instances of banksplaining.

### **Example 1: Mortgage Loans**

- Customer asks: "What’s my effective interest rate?"

- Banker responds: "Well, considering the [APR](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/i/interest/annual-percentage-rate-apr/), compounded over an annual basis while adjusting for closing costs and front-loaded interest amortization, the effective interest rate is based on a diminishing principal structure."

- Reality: The banker could simply say, "Your true cost, including fees and interest, comes out to about X% per year."

### **Example 2: Investment Portfolio**

- Client asks: "What are the risks in my portfolio?"

- Wealth manager responds: "Given the beta coefficients and Sharpe ratios, we see that your exposure to systemic risk is within the standard deviation threshold, with a convexity profile that aligns with macroeconomic trends."

- Reality: "Your investments might fluctuate in value, but we’ve balanced them to limit losses during downturns."

## **Analogy for Banksplaining**

Imagine you go to a mechanic to understand what’s wrong with your car. Instead of saying, "You need a new battery," they say, "The internal chemical reaction efficiency of your current energy storage unit has deteriorated due to extensive thermal cycles, leading to insufficient cranking amps." That’s banksplaining in finance.

## **ELI5 (Explain Like I’m 5)**
