## Brief Definition and Origin

The balance of payments (BOP) is a comprehensive record of a country's economic transactions with the rest of the world over a specific period, typically a year. Originating from the need to track international trade and capital flows, the modern BOP concept was formalized in the early 20th century as global economic integration intensified.

- Policy Formulation: Central banks and governments use BOP information to shape monetary and fiscal policies.

- Investment Decisions: International investors analyze BOP data to assess country risks and opportunities.
