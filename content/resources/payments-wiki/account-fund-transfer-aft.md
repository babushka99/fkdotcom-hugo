The advent of electronic payment systems in the late 20th century addressed these issues, giving rise to AFT as a streamlined, secure way to transfer funds.

AFT gained prominence with the development of payment networks like Visa and Mastercard, which provided the infrastructure for secure, global transactions. These systems paved the way for innovations like [automated clearing house (ACH)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/automated-clearing-house-ach/) transfers, wire transfers, and digital wallets.
