## What are Virtual IBANs?

A Virtual IBAN [(International Bank Account Number)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/i/what-is-an-iban/) is a unique identifier linked to a central physical bank account. It serves as a virtual address for receiving or sending payments, enabling businesses to track and manage financial transactions more efficiently. Unlike traditional IBANs tied directly to a specific bank account, virtual IBANs act as proxies, routing payments through the central account without needing multiple bank accounts.

### Analogy:

Think of virtual IBANs as separate "mailboxes" for receiving financial transactions. Even though all mail is delivered to one house (the primary account), each mailbox (virtual IBAN) helps sort and identify which person or department the mail is for.

## Origins and Backstory

Traditional bank accounts were cumbersome for handling [cross-border payments](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cross-border-payments-2/) due to high fees, reconciliation issues, and limited scalability.
