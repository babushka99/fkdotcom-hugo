Let's explore the concept of a "check" (American English) or "cheque" (British English) in the banking and financial services domain. The different spellings are simply a result of linguistic variations between American and British English.

### What is a Check/Cheque?

A check or cheque is a written, dated, and signed instrument that directs a bank to pay a specific sum of money to the bearer or the person whose name is written on the check. It is a form of negotiable instrument, meaning it is transferable from one person to another.

### Who Uses It?

- **Individuals:** For personal transactions like paying rent, gifts, or settling debts.

- **Businesses:** For transactions like paying suppliers, salaries, or services.

- **Governments and Non-Profit Organizations:** For disbursements, grants, and other financial transactions.

### Where is it Used?

Checks are used worldwide, but their popularity varies. In some countries, like the United States, they are still commonly used, while in others, digital payments have largely replaced them.

### Who Issues It?

Checks are issued by individuals or entities (businesses, organizations) that hold a [checking account](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/checking-account/) with a bank.
