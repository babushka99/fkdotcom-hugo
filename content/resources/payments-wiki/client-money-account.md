#### Definition and Origin

**Client Money Account**: A Client Money Account is a specialized bank account used by financial institutions to hold client funds separately from their own operating funds. This account ensures that client money is safeguarded and is not used for the institution's own purposes.

**Origin**: The concept of Client Money Accounts has its roots in regulatory frameworks designed to protect client funds, particularly in sectors such as investment and brokerage services. Historically, financial institutions held client funds in their own accounts, leading to concerns about potential misuse.
