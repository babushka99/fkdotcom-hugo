### Brief Overview:

A dark pool refers to private financial forums or exchanges for trading securities, not accessible by the public. They're called "dark" because, unlike traditional stock exchanges, the details of the trades aren't published before the transaction is executed. This setup is designed for trading large blocks of securities without impacting the market before the trade is executed.

### Definition:

Dark pools are private exchanges or trading platforms that enable investors to trade securities anonymously, with trades only made public after they are completed. This allows participants to execute large orders without the market reacting to these trades, which could affect the price of the security.

### Layman's Definition:

Imagine a secret marketplace where big players like investment banks and [hedge funds](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/h/hedge-fund/) buy and sell huge amounts of stocks or bonds without anyone else knowing until after the deal is done. This secrecy helps them avoid tipping off the market, which could drive prices up or down.

### How Does It Work?

- In a dark pool, an investor submits an order to buy or sell a large quantity of securities.

- The trade is matched internally within the dark pool, often without a fixed price until execution.

- For example, if a hedge fund wants to sell 1 million shares of a company, the dark pool may match this order with one or multiple buy orders without the wider market knowing until after the trade is completed.

### Where It Is Used:

- Among institutional investors

- In financial markets for equities, [bonds](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/bonds/), and other securities

### Why It Is Used:

- To avoid market impact (price movements) before executing large orders

- For potential price improvement and lower transaction costs

### Who Uses It:

- Institutional investors, such as mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds

- Large private investors

### Who Issues It:

### Who Regulates It:

- Regulatory bodies like the U.S.[ Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/) (SEC) oversee dark pools within their jurisdiction, ensuring they comply with financial regulations.

### Top Usage:
