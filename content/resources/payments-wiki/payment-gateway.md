## Definition

A **Payment Gateway** is a digital service that authorizes and processes payments between customers and merchants. It acts as a bridge between a website or a point-of-sale (POS) system and a payment processor, ensuring transactions are secure and completed efficiently.

## Background

Before online payments became mainstream, transactions were primarily conducted through cash, checks, or direct bank transfers. With the rise of [e-commerce](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/e/e-commerce/) and digital transactions, businesses needed a secure way to accept payments from customers worldwide. The emergence of payment gateways revolutionized the industry by providing a seamless and encrypted way to process payments instantly.

## How Payment Gateways Are Used in the Industry Today

- **E-Commerce:** Online stores use payment gateways to accept credit cards, digital wallets, and BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) transactions.

- **Retail & Point-of-Sale (POS) Systems:** Brick-and-mortar businesses integrate payment gateways to process card and contactless payments.

- **Subscription Services:** Platforms like Netflix and Spotify use gateways to handle recurring billing.

- **Mobile Payments:** Apps like Apple Pay and Google Pay leverage gateways to process secure tap-and-go transactions.

- **International Transactions:** Businesses use multi-currency payment gateways to accept cross-border payments seamlessly.

## How Does It Work? (Examples)

### Example 1: Online Purchase

A customer buys a laptop from an e-commerce website. When they enter their card details and click ‘Pay,’ the payment gateway encrypts the information, sends it to the [payment processor](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/p/payment-processor/) for authorization, and upon approval, completes the transaction, notifying both the buyer and seller.

### Example 2: In-Store Card Payment

A customer swipes or taps their credit card at a POS terminal. The payment gateway securely sends the transaction data to the acquiring bank, which then requests approval from the issuing bank. If approved, the funds are transferred, and the transaction is completed.

## Analogy for Understanding Payment Gateways

Imagine you are mailing a letter. The payment gateway is like a postal service that picks up your letter (payment request), ensures it's securely packed (encryption), sends it to the recipient (merchant’s bank), and returns a delivery confirmation (payment approval) so you know it was received successfully.

It is like a magic tunnel that takes money safely from your bank and gives it to the store when you buy something online or in a shop.
