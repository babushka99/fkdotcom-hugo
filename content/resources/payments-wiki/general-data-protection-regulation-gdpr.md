### Definition and Origin

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law that came into effect in the European Union (EU) on May 25, 2018. It was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect EU citizens' data privacy, and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. GDPR replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive, introducing stricter requirements for handling personal data and granting individuals greater control over their personal information.

While it is an EU regulation, its scope is global, affecting any organization that processes the personal data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is located. This broad applicability has led to a global shift in how personal data is handled, with many countries adopting similar regulations.
