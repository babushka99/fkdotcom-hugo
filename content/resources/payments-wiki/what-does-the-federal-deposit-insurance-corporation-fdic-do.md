The FDIC is funded by premiums that banks and savings institutions pay for deposit insurance coverage. These premiums are calculated based on a formula that takes into account the amount of deposits insured, the riskiness of the institution, and other factors.

- What is the formula for FDIC insurance premiums? The formula for calculating FDIC insurance premiums is complex and takes into account a number of factors, including the institution's total deposits, the level of risk it poses to the insurance fund, and the amount of any past losses it has incurred. The specific details of the formula can be found on the FDIC's website.

For example, let's say a bank has $100 million in deposits and is considered to be a moderate-risk institution. The bank would be required to pay an annual premium to the FDIC based on a percentage of its total deposits. Let's say the premium rate is 10 basis points (0.10%) for moderate-risk institutions. In this case, the bank would be required to pay an annual premium of $100,000 (0.10% x $100 million) to the FDIC for deposit insurance coverage.
