## Executive Summary

- Survivorship bias occurs when we focus only on people or things that made it past a selection process while overlooking those that didn't

- In crypto trading, this bias leads investors to base strategies on successful traders/coins while ignoring failed ones

- The concept originated from Abraham Wald's WWII aircraft analysis, revealing the importance of examining "invisible" failures

- This cognitive error affects decision-making across multiple fields, from business to education

- Understanding survivorship bias helps make more balanced and informed choices

## Understanding Survivorship Bias

Imagine walking through an art museum and concluding that "becoming an artist is a path to success" because you only see the masterpieces that made it onto the walls. This illustrates survivorship bias – you're not seeing the thousands of artists whose work never made it into museums.

### Origins and Historical Context

The term gained prominence during World War II through mathematician [Abraham Wald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Wald)'s work with the Statistical Research Group. When analyzing bomber aircraft returning from missions, military officials initially wanted to add armor where they saw bullet holes. However, Wald pointed out that they were only examining the planes that survived – the ones that were shot in other areas had been destroyed. This revolutionary insight led to protecting the areas without visible damage, significantly improving aircraft survival rates.

### Survivorship Bias in Cryptocurrency Trading

In the [crypto](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cryptocurrency/) world, survivorship bias manifests particularly strongly. Traders often:

- Study successful trading strategies while ignoring countless failed approaches

- Focus on cryptocurrencies that survived bear markets, overlooking thousands that failed

- Follow "crypto influencers" who happened to make correct predictions, disregarding those who made incorrect calls but stopped posting

## Key Principles

- Selection Process Visibility: Only successful outcomes remain visible, while failures disappear from view

- Data Skewing: Available information becomes skewed toward success stories

- False Pattern Recognition: People draw incorrect conclusions by analyzing incomplete data sets

- Confirmation Bias Interaction: Survivorship bias often reinforces existing beliefs about success

## Real-World Applications

#### Cryptocurrency Markets

Consider Bitcoin's rise: Many investors point to early [Bitcoin](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/bitcoin/) adopters becoming millionaires, but rarely mention countless failed cryptocurrencies or investors who lost everything. This creates a distorted view of crypto investment risks and opportunities.

#### Beyond Crypto

- Business: Studying only successful startups while ignoring failed ones creates unrealistic expectations

- Education: Following only the paths of successful dropouts (like Bill Gates) while ignoring thousands who struggled

- Investment: Mutual fund performance reports typically exclude funds that closed due to poor performance

## Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Pros

- Provides [optimism](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/o/optimistic-rollup/) and motivation by showcasing successful examples

- Can identify truly exceptional performance when properly contextualized

- Helps establish benchmarks for success

#### Cons

- Creates unrealistic expectations about success rates

- Leads to poor decision-making based on incomplete information

- May result in unnecessary risk-taking, especially in investments

## Controversies and Challenges

The main controversy surrounds the balance between inspiration and reality. While success stories motivate, they can also mislead. In cryptocurrency trading, this has led to debates about responsible reporting of trading success and the role of influencers in shaping market expectations.

### Global Impact

Survivorship bias affects decision-making worldwide, influencing:

- Investment strategies across different markets

- Educational and career choices

- Business development and innovation

- Public policy and regulation

## Conclusion

Understanding survivorship bias is crucial for making better decisions in cryptocurrency trading and beyond. By acknowledging this cognitive error, we can better evaluate opportunities, assess risks, and make more informed choices. Whether you're an investor, entrepreneur, or student, recognizing survivorship bias helps maintain a realistic perspective on success and failure.

The next time you hear about a wildly successful crypto trader or see impressive investment returns, remember to ask: "What about the ones that didn't make it?" This simple question can help protect against the distorting effects of survivorship bias and lead to better decision-making.
