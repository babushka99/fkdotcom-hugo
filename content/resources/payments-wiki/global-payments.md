## Definition 
Global payments refer to the systems and processes that enable the transfer of money across international borders, using various currencies and payment methods.

## Background / Backstory 
The concept of global payments has evolved considerably over the years. Initially, international transactions were labor-intensive and reliant on traditional banking methods. Wire transfers were often slow, taking days to process, and subject to high fees. As technology advanced, so did the methods for transferring funds. The introduction of the internet and mobile technology has revolutionized this space, making instant payments and [digital currency](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/digital-currency/) a reality. Diverse payment solutions have emerged, transforming how businesses and consumers send and receive money globally.

## How is Global Payments used in the Industry today
Today, global payments play a crucial role in various sectors, including banking, e-commerce, and remittances. Businesses utilize [international payment systems](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cross-border-payments/) to facilitate trade, allowing them to buy and sell goods across different countries efficiently. Consumers rely on global payment systems for online shopping, sending money to relatives abroad, or managing investments. The prevalence of digital wallets and real-time payments signifies a shift in consumer preference towards more immediate and accessible transaction methods.

## It's Significance
The significance of global payments in today’s industry cannot be overstated. They support economic growth by enabling easier access to international markets, fostering competition, and enhancing consumer choice. For example, e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Alibaba heavily depend on global payment systems to operate seamlessly across various currencies and regulations. This flexibility allows businesses to cater to a global audience, driving revenue growth and market expansion.

## How does it work?
Global payments work through a multi-step process involving the sender, recipient, and various intermediaries, including banks and payment processors. Here’s a simplified explanation:

- The Sender initiates the payment using a chosen method (bank transfer, credit card, or digital wallet).
- The payment request is routed through [payment rails](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/p/what-are-payment-rails/) (networks that facilitate transactions).
- Currency conversion occurs if different currencies are involved, often through a [foreign exchange (FX)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/fx-foreign-exchange/) service.
- The payment is processed, verified for security, and the transaction is settled.
- The Recipient receives the funds, which may be credited to their account instantly or after a set processing time.

Example 1: A business in the U.S. purchases goods from a supplier in China. The U.S. business uses its bank to transfer dollars, which are converted to Chinese yuan before reaching the supplier.

Example 2: A family in the U.K. sends money to a relative in India using a mobile app. The funds are converted to Indian rupees and quickly delivered to the family member's digital wallet.

## ELI5
Imagine you want to buy a toy from your friend's shop, but they only accept magic coins from a different country. You have regular coins. So, you ask a wizard (your bank) to change your coins into magic coins. The wizard takes a little time and a bit of your coins as a fee, turns them into magic coins, and sends them to your friend, who can then give you the toy. In this case, the wizard helps you make the exchange across borders.

Consumers rely on these systems for everyday transactions, while businesses depend on them for international trade and growth.
