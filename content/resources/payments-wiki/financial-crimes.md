**Financial Crimes in the Banking and Financial Services Sector: A Comprehensive Overview**

## Definition

Financial crimes are illegal acts committed by an individual or a group of people to obtain a financial or professional advantage. In the context of banking and finance, these crimes typically involve money laundering, fraud, embezzlement, insider trading, bribery, and cybercrimes related to financial data.

## Usage Context

They also frequently involve the exploitation of payment systems and money transfer services for illicit purposes.

## Importance

They can lead to substantial financial losses, undermine consumer trust, and harm the reputation of financial institutions. Addressing it is crucial for maintaining market confidence, ensuring the security of transaction and investment, and complying with international regulations like [Anti-Money Laundering (AML)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/anti-money-laundering-aml/) standards.
