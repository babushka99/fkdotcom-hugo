## Brief Definition and Origin

Mattress Cash, also known as "under-the-mattress money," refers to physical currency kept at home rather than in a bank. This practice dates back centuries, originating from times of economic instability and distrust in financial institutions.

## Current Usage and Importance of Mattress Cash

Today, Mattress Cash remains relevant in various contexts:

- In regions with unstable banking systems

- Among individuals distrustful of financial institutions

- In cash-based informal economies

- As a response to negative interest rates in some countries

Its significance lies in its role as an alternative to formal banking, impacting [monetary policy](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/m/monetary-policy/) and financial inclusion efforts.

## Stakeholders and Implementation

Key stakeholders include:

- Individuals holding cash

- Banks losing potential deposits

- Governments and central banks concerned with monetary control

- Law enforcement agencies monitoring potential illicit activities

Implementation is simple - individuals physically store cash. However, this presents challenges for [AML compliance](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/aml-compliance/), tax authorities, and economic policymakers trying to manage the money supply.

## Future Outlook

The future of Mattress Cash may be influenced by:
