## Executive Summary

- Banking as a Platform (BaaP) refers to a model where banks offer their infrastructure, data, and services to third-party developers via APIs, enabling the creation of new financial products and services.

- It allows fintech companies, businesses, and developers to integrate banking functions such as payments, lending, and account management into their applications.

- BaaP fosters innovation in financial services by enabling collaboration between traditional banks and technology-driven firms.

- The model enhances customer experience, expands financial inclusion, and improves operational efficiency for financial institutions.

- Regulatory frameworks, such as Open Banking initiatives, play a key role in shaping the adoption of BaaP worldwide.

## Definition of Banking as a Platform (BaaP)

Banking as a Platform (BaaP) is a financial model in which banks provide their digital infrastructure and services to external developers through [APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/application-programming-interface-api/). This approach allows third-party fintech companies, businesses, and startups to build and offer financial services without needing to become fully licensed banks. By leveraging BaaP, organizations can embed banking functionalities such as payments, credit, and compliance into their own applications while relying on traditional banks for core financial operations.

## Background

The concept of BaaP emerged as part of the broader digital transformation in banking. Traditionally, banks operated as closed entities, offering financial products exclusively through their own branches and digital channels. However, with the rise of fintech innovations and changing consumer expectations, banks began adopting open APIs to collaborate with third-party service providers. This shift was driven by regulatory changes, such as the European Union's PSD2 (Revised Payment Services Directive) and Open Banking initiatives, which mandated banks to share financial data with authorized third parties securely. Today, major financial institutions globally are adopting the BaaP model, facilitating the rapid development of personalized and innovative financial products.

### How Is Banking as a Platform Used in the Industry Today?

- **Embedded Finance:** Businesses integrate banking functions like payments, loans, and account management into their platforms (e.g., ride-hailing apps offering wallets).

- **Fintech Collaboration:** Startups partner with banks to launch new financial products without obtaining banking licenses.

- **Open Banking Services:** [Banks provide access to account information and transaction data to authorized third parties, enabling personalized financial services.](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/o/open-banking/)

- **Banking API Marketplaces:** Financial institutions offer API ecosystems where developers can create new services using banking infrastructure.

- **Regulatory Compliance & Security:** BaaP ensures secure data sharing while adhering to financial regulations like PSD2 and [GDPR](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/g/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/).

### How Does Banking as a Platform (BaaP) Work? (Detailed Examples)

- **Embedded Payments Example:** An e-commerce platform integrates a bank’s payment API, allowing customers to pay directly from their bank accounts without leaving the website.

- **Fintech Lending Example:** A fintech company uses a bank’s [credit scoring](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/credit-score/) and lending API to offer instant loans to users without having its own banking license.

### Simple Analogy

Banking as a Platform is like a food delivery app that connects restaurants, couriers, and customers. Just as restaurants use the app’s platform to sell food without building their own delivery network, fintechs and businesses use BaaP to offer financial services without creating their own banking infrastructure.

### ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)

Imagine a toy store that lets other stores borrow its shelves to sell their toys. The toy store doesn’t make the toys, but it provides the space and tools to help others sell them. That’s how banks let fintech companies use their banking services to create new apps and products.
