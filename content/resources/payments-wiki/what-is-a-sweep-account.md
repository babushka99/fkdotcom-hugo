## What Are Sweep Accounts?

A sweep account is a [financial tool](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/financial-instrument/) that automatically transfers excess cash from a primary checking or brokerage account into an interest-bearing account or short-term investment vehicle. This process ensures that idle funds are put to productive use, earning interest or investment returns rather than sitting unused.

## Origins and Evolution

Sweep accounts were introduced as a response to regulations restricting banks from paying interest on business [checking accounts](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/checking-account/). Financial institutions developed this tool to help businesses and individuals earn a return on their excess funds while maintaining accessibility. Initially adopted by corporations, sweep accounts are now widely used by individual investors and financial institutions worldwide.

## How Sweep Accounts Work

- **Threshold Setting**: Account holders set a minimum balance threshold in their checking or brokerage account.

- **Daily Sweeping**: At the end of each business day, any funds exceeding this threshold are automatically transferred to a pre-designated investment or savings account.

- **Return on Investment**: Funds are typically placed in money market funds, government securities, or other short-term instruments.

- **Automatic Reversal**: When the primary account needs funds, money is transferred back to maintain liquidity.

## Practical Applications

### Business Cash Management

- Companies use sweep accounts to maximize interest earnings on idle cash while ensuring operational [liquidity](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/l/liquidity/).

- Example: A retail business with daily cash inflows automatically moves surplus funds into an interest-bearing account overnight and transfers them back when needed for payroll or expenses.

### Personal Banking

- High-net-worth individuals use sweep accounts to optimize their finances without manual fund management.

- Example: An individual maintains a checking account for expenses, and excess funds are swept into a money market fund, earning passive income.

### Investment Firms & Brokerages

- Example: A stock traderâ€™s unused capital is automatically invested in a short-term fund, earning interest while awaiting the next trade.
