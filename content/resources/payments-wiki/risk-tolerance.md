Risk tolerance (RT) refers to the degree of uncertainty or potential financial loss that an individual or organization is willing to withstand while pursuing financial or business objectives. It is a crucial concept in investment management, corporate strategy, and financial planning.

## Background

Risk tolerance (RT) has long been a fundamental principle in financial decision-making.

### Example 1: Investment Portfolio Allocation

An investor with a high risk tolerance might [allocate 80% of their portfolio to stocks and cryptocurrencies](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/r/risk-on-assets/), while a conservative investor with low risk tolerance may focus on bonds and stable assets.

## Analogy for Understanding Risk Tolerance (RT)

Both approaches are valid, depending on personal comfort levels and excitement preferences.
