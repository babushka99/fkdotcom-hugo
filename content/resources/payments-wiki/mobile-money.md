This service is widely used in developing countries where banking infrastructure is limited.

## Background

The concept of mobile money emerged in the early 2000s as mobile phone penetration increased, especially in developing regions. One of the most notable success stories is **M-Pesa**, launched in Kenya in 2007 by Safaricom. It demonstrated how it could transform economies by providing financial access to millions of people previously excluded from traditional banking.

## How Does It Work? (Examples)

### Example 2: Paying Utility Bills

A customer pays their electricity bill using mobile money by selecting the bill payment option on their phone, entering their account number, and confirming the transaction. The utility provider receives the payment instantly.

## Analogy for Understanding Mobile Money

Think of it like a digital piggy bank in your phone. You can add money, take it out, or send it to someone else with just a few taps, without needing a physical bank.
