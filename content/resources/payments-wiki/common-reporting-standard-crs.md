## Definition of Common Reporting Standard (CRS)

The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) is a global standard for the automatic exchange of financial account information between governments around the world, developed by the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)](https://www.oecd.org/en.html). Its primary aim is to combat tax evasion by facilitating the transparent exchange of financial information between countries' tax authorities. Under the CRS, financial institutions are required to identify customers' tax residencies and report their financial accounts to their local tax authority, which then exchanges this information with tax authorities in other countries.

## Usage Context

CRS is widely used in the banking and financial industry, including banks, insurance companies, investment firms, and other financial institutions. It applies to various financial accounts, including bank accounts, investment income, certain insurance policies, and interests in certain entities.
