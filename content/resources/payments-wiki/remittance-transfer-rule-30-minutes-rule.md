## Demystifying the Remittance Transfer Rule: A Guide for Money Transfers in the US

Sending money abroad, a practice known as remitting (or remittance), plays a crucial role in the global economy. In the US, however, it's vital to understand the **Remittance Transfer Rule**: **30 Minutes Rule**, a federal regulation safeguarding consumers involved in international money transfers.

## Legal Definition and Origin

The Remittance Transfer Rule, formally outlined in **Subpart B of Regulation E** of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, originated from the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb/). Enacted in 2013, with amendments in 2020, this rule aims to provide transparency, error resolution mechanisms, and cancellation rights for consumers engaging in remittance transfers.

## What the Rule Means

In simpler terms, the rule mandates remittance transfer providers (businesses facilitating international money transfers) to:

- **Disclose key information:** Before you initiate a transfer, the provider must clearly and upfront disclose fees, exchange rates, estimated delivery time, and other vital details. This allows you to make informed decisions.

- **Offer cancellation rights:** You have 30 minutes after initiating the transfer to cancel it and receive a full refund. For pre-scheduled transfers (3 or more business days in advance), specific cancellation rules apply.

- **Facilitate error resolution:** If you encounter issues with your transfer (e.g., missing funds, incorrect delivery), you have 180 days to report the error. The provider must investigate and, in certain cases, offer remedies like refunds or resending the transfer.

## Who is Applicable?

The Remittance Transfer Rule applies to:

- **Consumers:** Individuals in the US sending money abroad through remittance transfer providers.

- **Remittance Transfer Providers:** Any entity (banks, money service businesses, etc.) [facilitating remittance transfers](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/r/remittance-service-provider-rsp/) for consumers as part of their regular business. Exceptions exist for small entities handling fewer than 500 transfers per year.

## How the Rule Works

Imagine you want to send money to a family member in your home country. Here's how the rule comes into play:

**Initiate the transfer**. Provide recipient details, transfer amount, and choose your preferred delivery method.

- **Choose a remittance transfer provider.** Compare fees, [exchange rates](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/e/exchange-rate/), and services offered by different providers.

- **Initiate the transfer.** Provide recipient details, transfer amount, and choose your preferred delivery method.

- **Pre-payment disclosures:** Before you pay, the provider must disclose all relevant information, including fees, exchange rates, estimated delivery time, and cancellation rights.

- **Payment and receipt:** Once you authorize the payment, the provider must issue a receipt summarizing the same information.

- **Cancellation window:** Under the **Remittance Transfer Rule: 30 Minutes Rule**, you have 30 minutes to cancel the transfer and receive a full refund.

- **Delivery and potential errors:** If the transfer encounters issues, you have 180 days to report the error to the provider. They must investigate and attempt to resolve the issue.

- **Dispute resolution:** If the provider's resolution doesn't satisfy you, you can file a complaint with the CFPB or seek legal assistance.

### Examples

**Example 1:** Sarah uses a money transfer app to send $500 to her brother in Brazil. Before confirming the transfer, the app clearly displays the exchange rate, fees, and estimated delivery time of 24 hours. Sarah confirms the transfer and receives a receipt. Within the 30-minute window, she receives an urgent message from her brother and decides to cancel the transfer. The app promptly refunds the full amount without issue.

**Example 2:** David sends $1,000 to his grandmother in India through a bank. Although the transfer initially appears successful, his grandmother doesn't receive the money after a week. David reports the error to the bank within 180 days. The bank investigates and discovers a technical error at the receiving bank in India. They work with the Indian bank to resend the money, which reaches David's grandmother within a few days.
