## Definition of Utility Coin

A utility coin is a [cryptocurrency](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cryptocurrency/) that provides users with access to specific services or functions within a blockchain ecosystem. Dogecoin is an example of a utility coin, primarily used for tipping, donations, and low-cost transactions.

## Background of Utility Coin

Dogecoin was introduced in 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a parody of [Bitcoin](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/bitcoin/), featuring the Shiba Inu dog meme.

Over time, Dogecoin transitioned from a meme coin to a practical digital currency for online tipping and payments.
