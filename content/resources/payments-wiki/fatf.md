FATF stands for the Financial Action Task Force. It is known as the Groupe d'action financi√®re in French. The organization was formed in 1989.

Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental organization that sets global standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Its membership consists of 37 countries, as well as two international organizations (the European Commission and the Gulf Cooperation Council).

The primary function of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is to develop and promote policies, laws, and regulations to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Some of its primary functions include:
