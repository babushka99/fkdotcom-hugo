### Brief Definition and Origin

**Payment orchestration** is a strategic approach in the financial sector that streamlines and optimizes the management of various payment methods and providers through a single platform. Originating in the early 2010s with the proliferation of e-commerce, payment orchestration was developed to handle the increasing complexity of global transactions involving multiple payment systems and regulatory environments.

### Current Usage and Importance

Today, payment orchestration is crucial in the financial industry as it allows businesses to integrate multiple payment gateways, processors, and card schemes into a cohesive system. This integration supports global commerce by simplifying [transactions across different currencies](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/payments-wiki/currency-transaction-report-ctr/) and regulations. It also enhances customer experience by offering flexible [payment options and reduces failed transactions](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/payments-wiki/understanding-credit-funding-transactions-cft-and-account-funding-transactions-aft-in-the-world-of-card-payments/) through intelligent routing.
