## How does it work?

- 
**Pay-Per-View**: A website might provide exclusive articles for a fee. When a reader decides to access a pay-per-view article, they make a one-time payment through a payment gateway. The revenue generated from this transaction can go directly to the writer and the platform that hosts the content.
