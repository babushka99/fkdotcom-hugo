## Analogy for Understanding Interpretive Letters

Think of interpretive letters as "official rule clarifications." Imagine you’re playing a board game with complicated rules, and you ask the game creator to confirm if a particular move is allowed. The official response you receive isn’t a new rule, but a clarification of how an existing rule applies to your situation. That’s how they function in finance and law.

## ELI5 (Explain Like I’m 5)

Imagine you’re in school, and you’re not sure if you’re allowed to use a calculator on your math test. You ask your teacher, and they give you a note explaining that calculators are allowed for certain problems but not others. That note is like an interpretive letter—it explains the rules without changing them.
