From the establishment of banking institutions in ancient civilizations to modern-day digital banking, these systems have progressively adapted to meet the demands of the economy. The integration of technology, especially in recent decades, has transformed the landscape, introducing complex [payment systems](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/p/payment-processor/), [cryptocurrencies](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/blockchain/), and robust regulatory frameworks designed to combat financial crimes.

## How is Formal Financial Systems used in the Industry today
Formal financial systems are extensively utilized in various segments of the financial industry, including traditional banking and finance, payment systems, cryptocurrencies, and macroeconomic management.

In the realm of payment systems, they support real-time transactions and [cross-border payments](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cross-border-payments/), which are vital for global commerce. Cryptocurrencies leverage formal financial systems to enhance security and compliance, foster innovation, and create decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities.

## How does it work?
Formal financial systems operate through various components working in unison to create a secure framework for financial transactions.

**Example 1: Traditional Banking**

- A customer opens an account with a bank.
- The bank verifies the customer’s identity using KYC processes.
- The customer can now deposit money, transfer funds, and take out loans.
- All transactions are monitored to prevent fraud and comply with regulations.

**Example 2: Cryptocurrency Transactions**

- A user creates a [digital wallet](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/digital-wallet/) to store cryptocurrencies.
- They purchase cryptocurrency from an exchange; KYC processes verify their identity.
- Using blockchain technology, the user sends cryptocurrency to another wallet.
- The transaction is recorded securely on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## ELI5
Imagine formal financial systems like a big, friendly playground where kids (money and transactions) play with each other safely.

- Before playing, they need to check in with a trusted adult (KYC) to make sure they’re allowed to be there.
- They use special tools (payment systems) to exchange toys (money), so everyone gets what they want quickly and fairly.
- If someone tries to break the rules (commit fraud), the adult is there to help—making sure everyone plays nicely!

## Stakeholders and Implementation
Many stakeholders use formal financial systems, including banks, payment processors, government agencies, and cryptocurrency platforms. The implementation of these systems can be challenging due to various factors, including [regulatory compliance](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/financial-compliance/), technological updates, and ensuring security against cyber threats. Notable challenges include staying current with evolving regulations and integrating new technologies into existing frameworks without disrupting services.

## Pros & Cons

- Enhanced security and regulation compliance.
- Improved efficiency in transactions and operations.
- Supports innovation within the financial sector.

**Cons:**

- High implementation costs and complexity.
- Regulatory hurdles can limit flexibility.
- Risk of cyber threats and data breaches.

## Future Outlook
