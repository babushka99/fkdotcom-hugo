## Definition of Commodities Market

The commodities market is a [financial marketplace](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/financial-markets/) where raw materials and natural resources are bought, sold, and traded. These markets function through spot trading, where commodities are exchanged for immediate delivery, and futures contracts, where commodities are bought or sold for delivery at a future date. Commodities are essential to global trade and serve as key indicators of economic health and inflation trends.

## Background

The trading of commodities dates back centuries, with early civilizations exchanging goods like grains, spices, and precious metals. The formalization of commodity markets began with futures contracts, first introduced in the 19th century to stabilize agricultural markets. Over time, commodities trading expanded to include energy, metals, and financial derivatives, leading to the establishment of major exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the London Metal Exchange (LME). Today, the commodities market plays a vital role in global trade, investment portfolios, and risk management strategies for businesses and governments.
