## Definition

Delegated staking is a [staking](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/s/staking/) mechanism in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchain networks where token holders delegate their staking power to a trusted validator instead of running a staking node themselves. This allows users to earn staking rewards passively without the technical complexities of maintaining a node.

## Background 

Traditional PoS blockchains require [validators](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/v/validators/) to lock up a certain amount of tokens as collateral to validate transactions and secure the network. However, running a validator node requires technical expertise, significant hardware, and financial commitment. **Delegated staking emerged as a solution**, enabling smaller holders to participate by delegating their stake to professional validators. This model was first introduced by blockchains like **EOS, TRON, and Tezos**, making staking more accessible to the average investor.

## How Delegated Staking is Used in the Industry Today

It plays a vital role in the **crypto, blockchain, and DeFi space**, as it enhances network security, enables passive income generation, and promotes decentralization.

### How Does It Work?

- **Token holders** delegate their coins/tokens to a validator (or staker).

- The **validator** participates in block validation, securing the network.

- The network **rewards validators** with newly minted tokens and transaction fees.

- Validators **share rewards** with their delegators after deducting a fee.

### Example 1: Tezos Delegated Staking

- On the **Tezos blockchain**, users can stake their **XTZ tokens** by delegating them to a "baker" (validator).

- The baker validates transactions and earns **block rewards**.

- These rewards are **distributed** to all delegators proportionally to their stake.

- No tokens leave the user’s wallet—delegation is secure and risk-free.

### Example 2: Cardano Delegated Staking

- **Cardano (ADA)** allows users to delegate their stake to a **[staking pool](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/s/staking-pools/)** instead of running a node.

- The more ADA staked in a pool, the higher its chances of **being selected to validate transactions**.

- The staking pool operator earns rewards and distributes them among delegators.

- Delegators can **unstake anytime**, providing flexibility.

### Analogy: The Voting System

Imagine a **student council election** in a high school:

- Every student has a **vote (stake)** but not all want to run for council (become a validator).

- Instead, they **[delegate their votes](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/authorized-delegate/)** to a trusted candidate who represents their interests.

- If the candidate wins, they **share benefits** (rewards) with those who voted for them.

- If the candidate fails or acts poorly, students can **withdraw their vote** and support someone else.

## Stakeholders and Implementation

### Who Uses Delegated Staking?

- **Retail Investors & Small Token Holders**: Those who want staking rewards without running a node.

- **Validators & Staking Pools**: Entities that validate transactions and distribute rewards.

- **Blockchain Networks**: Protocols like **Tezos, Cardano, Polkadot, and Cosmos** use delegated staking to enhance security and decentralization.

### Challenges in Implementation

- **Validator Trust**: Delegators must choose reputable validators to avoid losses due to slashing (penalties for misbehavior).

- **Centralization Risks**: If too many people delegate to a few validators, it may lead to centralization.

- **Fee Structures**: Validators charge fees, reducing the delegator’s final rewards.

## Pros & Cons 

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
| **Easy Participation** – No need for technical expertise. | **Slashing Risks** – Validators’ mistakes can cause partial loss of funds. |
| **Passive Income** – Earn staking rewards automatically. | **Centralization Risks** – Large validators may dominate governance. |
| **Flexible Unstaking** – Many blockchains allow unstaking anytime. | **Validator Fees** – Validators take a cut from the rewards. |
| **Strengthens Network** – More participants enhance blockchain security. | **Limited Control** – Delegators rely on the validator’s performance. |

## Future Outlook of Delegated Staking

- **Liquid Staking Growth**: Platforms like **Lido and Rocket Pool** allow delegators to stake while maintaining liquidity.

- **DeFi & Staking Integration**: More DeFi protocols are integrating staking features for enhanced yield generation.

- **Improved Governance**: Upcoming blockchain upgrades may introduce **more transparent and fair delegation models** to prevent centralization risks.

- **Layer 2 Staking**: Rollups and L2 solutions may introduce new forms of delegated staking, enhancing efficiency.
