## Definition of Audited Financials
Audited financials refer to financial statements that have been examined and verified by an external, independent auditor. This process ensures the accuracy and credibility of the information presented, providing stakeholders with a reliable source of data. Audited financial statements typically include the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement, reflecting the company’s performance over a specific period. They are critical in industries where transparency and trust are paramount, particularly in preventing [fraud](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/fraud/) and ensuring compliance with various regulations.

## Background / Backstory on Audited Financials
The practice of auditing financial statements has roots that trace back centuries, evolving as businesses grew in complexity. Initially, audits were informal, conducted by trusted individuals within the organization. However, as regulations tightened and industries expanded, especially in finance, the need for impartiality became evident. This led to the establishment of formal auditing standards and the creation of professional organizations. In today's rapidly changing landscape, particularly in areas like [blockchain](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/blockchain/) and digital currencies, the importance of audited financials has surged, driven by the need for compliance with [KYC/AML regulations](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/aml-compliance/) and the evaluation of financial stability.

## How is Audited Financials Used in the Industry Today
Audited financials serve various purposes in industries that prioritize compliance and risk management. In [KYC/AML processes](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/k/know-your-customer-kyc/), they provide a clear picture of a company's financial activities, helping organizations screen for potential risks associated with money laundering or other illicit activities. In the realm of [blockchain analytics and transaction monitoring](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/t/transaction-monitoring/), audited financials are essential for assessing the legitimacy of businesses engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. This is especially relevant in transaction monitoring, where firms must ensure that their clients are financially solvent and compliant with regulations.

## How Audited Financials are Used in the Industry Today and Its Significance
Audited financials are significant in establishing trust and credibility in the financial ecosystem. For instance, in credit scoring, lenders rely on audited financials to assess a borrower's ability to repay loans. Similarly, in wallet screening, financial institutions check the audited financials of cryptocurrency wallets to determine if they are associated with legitimate companies. The significance of these statements cannot be overstated; they form the backbone of informed decision-making across various sectors.

## How Does It Work?
When a company wants to provide transparency regarding its financial status, it hires an external auditor. The auditor reviews the company’s records, assesses internal controls, and tests transactions to ensure accuracy.  

Example 1: A tech startup seeks investment. Before a venture capital firm invests, they require the startup’s audited financials to verify its claims of profitability and growth, thus minimizing investment risk.  

Example 2: A bank conducts due diligence on a company applying for a loan. They request the company's audited financials to assess its debt capacity, ensuring that the company can repay the loan without jeopardizing financial stability.

## ELI5
Imagine you have a lemonade stand. If you want your friend to invest in your stand, you need to show them that you sell a lot of lemonade and make good money. So, you ask your teacher, who knows a lot about money, to check your math and see how much lemonade you really sold. Once the teacher checks everything and says it's right, your friend trusts that your lemonade stand is worth investing in. That teacher is like the auditor, and your stand's sales records are like audited financials.

## Stakeholders and Implementation
Stakeholders include company executives, investors, regulators, and auditors. Each of these parties has a vested interest in the transparency provided by audited financials. Companies implement this process by hiring independent auditors who follow established standards. Notable challenges include the cost of audits, varying regulations across jurisdictions, and potential conflicts of interest if auditors are too close to the clients they serve.
