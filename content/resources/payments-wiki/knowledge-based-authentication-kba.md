### Definition of Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA)

**Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA)** is a security process used to verify the identity of individuals by asking them to answer at least one "secret" question. KBA is typically used in the context of identity verification for secure access to accounts and services.

### Understanding Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA)

#### What It Means

Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) relies on the principle that only the genuine user should know the answers to specific questions derived from their personal history or account information. These questions can be static (previously set by the user) or dynamic (generated from external databases).

#### Where It Is Used

- **Online Banking**: To verify identity before granting access to sensitive financial information.

- **Account Recovery**: To authenticate users who have forgotten their login details.

- **Transaction Verification**: To confirm [identity before approving high-value or unusual transactions](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/payments-wiki/customer-verification-levels-and-financial-transaction-limits-guidelines/).

#### Who Uses Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA)

- **Consumers**: Individual [users accessing online accounts or services](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/payments-wiki/payment-service-user-psu/).

- **Financial Institutions**: Banks, [credit unions](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/payments-wiki/what-is-the-difference-between-a-community-bank-and-a-credit-union/), and other financial entities to ensure security during online transactions.

- **Businesses**: Companies that require secure [access controls](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/payments-wiki/role-based-access-control-rbac/) for customer accounts.

### Purpose and Utilization

#### What It Is Used For

- **Identity Verification**: To ensure that [the person requesting access to an account or service](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/payments-wiki/identity-verification-idv/) is who they claim to be.

- **Fraud Prevention**: To reduce the risk of unauthorized access and identity theft.

#### Why It Is Used

- **Security Enhancement**: Provides an additional layer of security by verifying information that should only be known to the user.

- **User Convenience**: Allows users to authenticate themselves without the need for hardware tokens or [biometric data](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/payments-wiki/biometric-data/).

### Other Names

Knowledge-Based Authentication is also known as:

- **Secret Question Authentication**

- **Personal Security Questions**

### Examples

- **Online Banking Login**: When logging into her [bank account](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/payments-wiki/what-is-an-iban/), Emily is prompted to answer a personal security question about her first car's model, a detail previously set up in her banking profile.

- **Account Recovery Process**: John forgets his shopping website password and chooses to reset it. During the process, he's asked to answer questions about his recent transactions and previous addresses to verify his identity.

### Learning More

To learn more about Knowledge-Based Authentication, you can explore:

- **Cybersecurity Websites**: Resources like CISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency) or NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) offer guidelines and best practices.

- **Financial Security Guides**: Many banks provide information on their security measures, including KBA, on their websites.

- **Technology and Security Blogs**: Focused articles on current trends in cybersecurity might cover the evolution and effectiveness of Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA).

These resources can provide a deeper understanding of how Knowledge-Based Authentication works, its benefits, and its limitations in the realm of digital security and identity verification.
