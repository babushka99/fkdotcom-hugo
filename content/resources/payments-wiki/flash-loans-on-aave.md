## Definition

Flash Loans on Aave are uncollateralized loans that must be borrowed and repaid within a single blockchain transaction. Unlike traditional loans, they require no collateral and no credit checks because the loan must be repaid in the same block it's borrowed. This innovative DeFi mechanism enables users to access substantial liquidity instantly, provided they can ensure repayment within the same transaction.

## Background

Introduced by Aave in 2020, flash loans emerged as a groundbreaking DeFi innovation that challenged traditional lending paradigms. The concept was built on a simple yet powerful insight: if a loan is borrowed and repaid within the same transaction block, there's virtually no risk of default. This mechanism became possible due to Ethereum's atomic transactions, where either all operations in a transaction succeed, or none do.

## Industry Usage Today

Flash Loans on Aave have revolutionized DeFi trading and [arbitrage](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/currency-arbitrage/). Here's a detailed look at how they're used:

Example 1 - Multi-DEX Arbitrage:

- Borrow 1,000,000 USDC through Aave flash loan

- Identify ETH price discrepancy (e.g., $1,800 on Uniswap, $1,820 on SushiSwap)

- Buy 555.55 ETH on Uniswap ($1,000,000)

- Sell 555.55 ETH on SushiSwap ($1,011,101)

- Repay 1,000,000 USDC + 0.09% fee ($900)

- Profit: $10,201

Example 2 - Collateral Swap:

- Have existing loan of 100,000 USDC collateralized with 100 ETH at 75% LTV

- Take flash loan of 100,000 USDC

- Repay original loan, freeing up ETH

- Use ETH as collateral on different platform with better terms

- Borrow 100,000 USDC at new lower rate

- Repay flash loan

- Result: Same loan amount but better terms

Simple Analogy: Imagine you're at a gaming arcade. You spot an opportunity where Game A is selling rare items for 100 tokens, but Game B is buying them for 120 tokens. You don't have any tokens, but the arcade has a special "flash token" system. You can borrow tokens, buy items from Game A, sell to Game B, and return the tokens - all before your turn ends. If you fail to return the tokens before your turn ends, the entire sequence is canceled.
