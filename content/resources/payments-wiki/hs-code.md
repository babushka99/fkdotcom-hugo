HS Code, short for Harmonized System Code, is a standardized numerical method of classifying traded products. It is used by customs authorities around the world to identify products when assessing duties and taxes and for gathering statistics. The HS Code system is maintained by the World Customs Organization (WCO), an independent intergovernmental organization with over 180 member countries based in Brussels, Belgium.

### Definition and Purpose

The HS Code is a six-digit code that classifies and defines internationally traded goods. It's based on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. The system is harmonized, meaning that it's consistent across countries, simplifying international trade.

### What It Stands For and Its Meaning

The "HS" in HS Code stands for "Harmonized System". The system is designed to classify goods in a systematic and uniform manner, facilitating [international trade](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/i/international-trade/) and tariff determination.

### Usage in Trade

They are used by exporters, importers, customs officials, and other participants in international trade. They are essential for:

- **Determining Tariffs:** Different products have different tariff rates, and the HS Code helps in identifying the correct tariff applicable.

- **Trade Statistics:** They are used for collecting data on the quantity and value of goods traded internationally.

- **Trade Policies:** Governments use HS Codes to implement trade policies like trade sanctions, quotas, or anti-dumping duties.

### Issuance and Global Acceptance

The WCO revises the HS Code system every five years to keep up with changes in technology or trade patterns. While the WCO develops and maintains the system, individual countries can add additional digits to classify goods more specifically according to their own tariff and statistical needs.
