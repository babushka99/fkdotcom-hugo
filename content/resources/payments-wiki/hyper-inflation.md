### Definition

Hyper-inflation is an economic term describing an extremely high and typically accelerating rate of inflation, often exceeding 50% per month. It is characterized by a rapid and uncontrollable increase in prices and a consequent loss in the value of the country's currency. This phenomenon leads to a collapse in the purchasing power of money, making it difficult for people to afford basic goods and services.

### Usage Context

In the banking and financial industry, hyper-inflation is a critical scenario that influences decision-making, policy formulation, and strategic planning. It affects interest rates, lending practices, investment strategies, and currency valuation. [Financial institutions](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/financial-institution-fi/) closely monitor inflation indicators to adjust their operations and mitigate risks associated with hyper-inflation.

### Importance

Hyper-inflation is crucial in this sector because it directly impacts the stability and viability of financial operations. It can erode savings, increase the cost of borrowing, destabilize currencies, and lead to significant economic disruptions. Understanding and managing hyper-inflation is essential for maintaining the health of the financial system, ensuring economic stability, and protecting consumers' purchasing power.

### Users

The entities interacting with or affected by hyper-inflation include:

- **Banks and Financial Institutions:** Adjusting lending rates, managing currency risk.

- **Businesses:** Pricing strategies, budgeting, and financial planning.

- **Consumers:** Savings and investment decisions.

- **Regulatory Bodies and Central Banks:** Implementing [monetary policies](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/m/monetary-policy/) to combat inflation.

- **Investors:** Adjusting investment portfolios to hedge against inflation.

### Application

In the context of hyper-inflation, financial entities apply various strategies to mitigate its effects, such as:

- Implementing stringent compliance and [AML](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/anti-money-laundering-aml/) policies to prevent illicit activities that could exacerbate inflationary pressures.

- Negotiating trade agreements to stabilize currency exchange rates.

### Different Names

Hyper-inflation is also known as runaway inflation or galloping inflation, emphasizing the speed and uncontrollability of the price increases.

### Moral Issues
