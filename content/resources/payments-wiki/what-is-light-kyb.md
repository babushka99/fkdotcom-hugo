"KYB" stands for "Know Your Business," which is a principle used in the financial industry to verify the identity and assess the risk of business customers. This is akin to "KYC" (Know Your Customer) but is specifically oriented towards business clients. KYB processes are crucial in preventing and identifying potential money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities.

In the context of "light" KYB versus regular KYB, the distinction typically pertains to the depth and breadth of the verification and due diligence processes.

### Light KYB

- **Basic Verification**: Light KYB usually involves basic verification of the business. This might include checking the business name, registration number, registered address, and possibly some information about the directors.

- **Lower Risk**: It is often applied to businesses that are perceived to be of lower risk, either due to their size, industry, or the nature of their transactions.

- **Simplified Due Diligence**: The [due diligence](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/due-diligence-dd-2/) process is usually simplified and might not delve deeply into the ownership structure or financial dealings of the business.

- **Quick Onboarding**: Light KYB is often used in contexts where quick customer onboarding is a priority and the perceived risks are manageable.

### Regular KYB

- **Comprehensive Verification**: Regular [KYB](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/k/know-your-business-kyb/) involves a more thorough verification process. This includes verifying the business’s details, understanding its ownership structure, and checking the identities of the beneficial owners and senior managing officials.

- **Risk Assessment**: It involves a detailed risk assessment, which takes into account the business’s activities, transaction volumes, and geographies it operates in.

- **Enhanced Due Diligence**: For businesses that are perceived to be higher risk, enhanced due diligence processes may be applied. This could involve a deeper examination of the business’s financial transactions, relationships, and [regularity compliance](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/compliance-policies-procedures/).

- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Regular KYB also involves ongoing monitoring of the business relationship and its transactions to ensure that they are consistent with the business’s profile and risk assessment.
