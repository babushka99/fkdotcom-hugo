### Brief Definition and Origin

First Time Deposit (FTD) refers to the initial deposit made by a new customer in a banking or financial institution. Originating from the banking sector's need to track and incentivize new account openings, FTD has become a critical metric in evaluating customer acquisition and engagement strategies across various financial platforms, including online trading, banking, cryptocurrency exchanges, and digital wallets.

### Current Usage and Importance

Today, First Time Deposit (FTD) is a key indicator of growth and customer trust in the financial industry. It's widely used to assess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, onboarding processes, and product offerings. Beyond its role as a metric, FTD often triggers compliance and [AML (Anti-Money Laundering)](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/explainers/anti-money-laundering-aml/) procedures to ensure the legitimacy of new accounts and the security of financial transactions. Its importance is underscored in competitive markets where customer acquisition costs are high, and the initial deposit can also influence customer loyalty and lifetime value.

Implementation involves not just the technical process of accepting and processing the deposit but also aligning it with customer verification, compliance checks, and the seamless integration of new clients into the service offering.
