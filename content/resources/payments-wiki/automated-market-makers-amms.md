Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are a foundational element in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, revolutionizing how trades are conducted on blockchain platforms. Here's a comprehensive overview on AMMs.

### Brief Overview

AMMs are protocols that provide liquidity to the exchange they operate on through a decentralized, automatic mechanism, allowing [digital assets](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/digital-assets/) to be traded in an open and direct manner without the need for traditional market makers or order books.

### Definition 

An Automated Market Makers (AMMs) is a type of decentralized exchange protocol that relies on a mathematical formula to price assets. Instead of using traditional order books, AMMs use [liquidity pools](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/l/liquidity-pool/) that traders can trade against.

### Layman's Definition

Think of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) as self-operating vending machines for cryptocurrencies. Instead of matching buyers and sellers like a traditional exchange, these "vending machines" hold a bunch of coins that you can buy or sell from directly at prices set by a formula.

### Where It Is Used

AMMs are primarily used in the DeFi ecosystem on blockchain platforms, enabling trading, liquidity provision, and yield farming opportunities for cryptocurrencies.

### Why It Is Used

They offer a decentralized and permissionless way to trade and provide liquidity, reducing reliance on traditional financial intermediaries and enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of financial services.

### Who Uses Automated Market Makers (AMMs)

- Cryptocurrency traders and investors seeking to swap tokens.

- Liquidity providers who contribute assets to liquidity pools to earn fees.

- DeFi enthusiasts and developers engaged in building or participating in decentralized finance applications.

### Who Issues It

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are not issued by any single entity but are rather developed and deployed by teams or individuals within the DeFi ecosystem. These protocols are governed by [smart contracts](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/s/smart-contract/) on blockchain networks.

### Who Regulates It

Currently, there's limited direct regulation over Automated Market Makers (AMMs) specifically. However, broader cryptocurrency regulations by government bodies may indirectly affect how AMMs operate.

### Top Uses

- **Token Swapping:** Allowing users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another.

- **Liquidity Provision:** Users can supply assets to liquidity pools, earning transaction fees in return.

- **Yield Farming:** Participants can earn additional rewards, often in the form of the platform's native token, by providing liquidity.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- Decentralization offers reduced counterparty risk.

- 24/7 availability for trading and liquidity provision.

- Opportunities for earning through liquidity provision and yield farming.

**Cons:**

- Impermanent loss risk for liquidity providers.

- Can be more susceptible to price slippage in large trades.

- Complexity and technical barriers for new users.

### Examples of  Automated Market Makers (AMMs) Usage

- **Uniswap:** One of the most popular Automated Market Makers (AMMs), with billions of dollars in trading volume. It allows for the trading and liquidity provision of Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens.

- **SushiSwap:** A community-driven project offering similar services to Uniswap with additional features like yield farming.

- **Balancer:** Allows for the creation of customizable liquidity pools with up to eight tokens, adjusting weights and trading fees.

### Also Known As

Decentralized Market Maker, On-chain Market Maker.

### Real-world Analogy

Imagine a farmer's market where sellers ([liquidity providers](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/l/liquidity-provider/)) bring goods (cryptocurrencies) to sell. Buyers come to purchase goods directly based on prices set by an automatic pricing mechanism (AMM formula), without needing to negotiate or find a specific seller.
