### Brief Definition and Origin

A **Credit Default Swap (CDS)** is a financial [derivative](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/payments-wiki/derivatives/) that allows an investor to "swap" or offset their credit risk with that of another investor. Introduced in the early 1990s by J.P. Morgan, CDSs became widely used as a tool to manage credit risk and as a speculative instrument. Essentially, a CDS is a contract where one party (the buyer) pays a periodic fee to another party (the seller) in exchange for compensation if a third party (the reference entity) defaults on a debt obligation.
