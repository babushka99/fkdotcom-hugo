### Definition and Origin

**What is Interoperability in Payments?**
Interoperability in payments refers to the ability of different payment systems, whether operated by different entities or utilizing different technologies, to seamlessly connect and transact with each other. It ensures that payments can flow across various platforms, networks, and institutions without friction, enabling efficient and convenient financial transactions.

**Origin and Evolution**
The concept of interoperability in payments has evolved alongside advancements in technology and the growth of digital financial services. [Historically, payment systems](https://faisalkhan.com/2024/07/08/understanding-modern-payment-systems/) were often proprietary, limiting interactions between different banks or financial entities. Over time, as [digital payments](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/cryptocurrency/digital-payment-token-dpt/) gained prominence, the need for interoperability became more apparent to facilitate smoother transactions across diverse platforms and user bases.
