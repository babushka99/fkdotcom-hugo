An "atomic payment" in the context of payments and [cryptocurrency ](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cryptocurrency/)refers to a type of transaction that is indivisible and irreversible. The term "atomic" in this context is not an acronym but rather a concept borrowed from physics. In physics, an atom is the smallest unit of a matter that retains its identity, and similarly, an atomic payment is a transaction that either happens in its entirety or doesn't happen at all.

### Definition and Characteristics of Atomic Payments

- **Indivisibility**: The most crucial characteristic of an atomic payment is that it cannot be split into smaller transactions. The entire transaction must be completed successfully, or it fails altogether.

- **Irreversibility**: Once an atomic payment is made, it cannot be reversed. This is particularly important in the realm of cryptocurrency, where transactions are recorded on a [blockchain ](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/blockchain/)and cannot be altered once confirmed.

- **Conditional Execution**: Often, atomic payments are conditional, meaning they are executed only if certain predefined conditions are met. This is typically achieved through the use of smart contracts in the cryptocurrency world.

- **Simultaneity**: In cases of exchange transactions, atomic payments ensure that all parts of the transaction occur simultaneously. This means that if you are exchanging currency A for currency B, you will not lose currency A without receiving currency B in return.

### Examples of Atomic Payments

- **Cryptocurrency Exchange**: If Alice wants to exchange her Bitcoin for Bob's Ethereum, an [atomic swap](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/atomic-swaps/) can be used. The swap will ensure that Alice receives Ethereum only if Bob receives her Bitcoin at the same time. If either part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is voided.

- **Escrow Transactions**: In a [smart contract-based sale](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/s/smart-contract/), a buyer may deposit funds into a contract that releases the funds to the seller only upon the delivery of a product or service. If the product is not delivered as per the terms, the contract does not release the funds.

- **Cross-Chain Transactions**: If a user wants to exchange tokens from one blockchain for tokens on another blockchain, an atomic payment can facilitate this without the need for a trusted intermediary. The transaction is either completed fully across both chains or not at all.

In summary, atomic payments in the context of cryptocurrency and digital transactions refer to secure, indivisible, and irreversible transactions that occur entirely or not at all, often under predefined conditions. This concept is fundamental in ensuring trust and security in decentralized and digital financial transactions.
