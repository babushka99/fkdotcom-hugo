## Executive Summary

- **Wrapped Tokens**: Cryptocurrency tokens that represent another asset, typically used to enhance blockchain interoperability.

- **Purpose**: Enable cross-chain functionality and expand asset use cases.

- **Key Features**: Pegged value, custodial or smart contract-backed issuance, and cross-platform compatibility.

- **Use Cases**: DeFi platforms, liquidity provision, and cross-chain transactions.

- **Challenges**: Trust in custodians, complexity, and potential regulatory concerns.

## Introduction

Wrapped tokens are digital assets designed to represent another cryptocurrency or asset on a different blockchain. They bridge the gap between blockchains that cannot natively interact, enabling greater liquidity and functionality across decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. For example, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) allows Bitcoin holders to participate in [Ethereum-based DeFi](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/decentralized-finance-defi/) platforms.

## Origins and Backstory

The concept of wrapped tokens emerged as the blockchain industry expanded, highlighting the limitations of siloed ecosystems. Developers sought solutions to enable Bitcoin’s liquidity within Ethereum’s vibrant DeFi space. WBTC, launched in 2019, became one of the earliest examples of them. Since then, the use of wrapped tokens has grown, providing cross-chain compatibility for numerous assets.

## Key Principles

### Pegged Value

- Wrapped tokens maintain a 1:1 peg to the underlying asset’s value.

- Pegging is achieved through reserves held by custodians or locked in smart contracts.

### Custodial and Non-Custodial Models

- **Custodial**: Centralized entities hold the underlying asset and issue wrapped tokens.

Example: WBTC relies on custodians to hold Bitcoin reserves.

- **Non-Custodial**: [Smart contracts](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/s/smart-contract/) automate the process, removing centralized control.

Example: Wrapped tokens created on platforms like Ren or Thorchain.

### Interoperability

- Wrapped tokens enable assets to operate on blockchains other than their native chain, unlocking additional functionalities.

## Practical Applications

### DeFi Platforms

- Enable cross-chain participation in lending, staking, and liquidity pools.

**Example**: WBTC used as collateral on Ethereum-based platforms like MakerDAO and Aave.

### Cross-Chain Transactions

- Facilitate seamless value transfer across different blockchain networks.

**Example**: Using wrapped tokens to [bridge assets](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/crypto-bridge/) between Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.

### Liquidity Provision

- Increase the liquidity of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) by allowing non-native assets to trade.

**Example**: Wrapped ETH (WETH) used extensively on Uniswap for trading pairs.

### Asset Tokenization

- Represent real-world assets on blockchain platforms for increased accessibility and transparency.

**Example**: Wrapped tokens for gold or fiat currencies.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Interoperability**: Connects siloed blockchain ecosystems, increasing asset utility.

- **Liquidity**: Enhances liquidity for [DeFi applications](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/decentralized-applications-dapps/) and trading platforms.

- **Efficiency**: Enables faster and cheaper transactions by leveraging alternative blockchains.

- **Increased Use Cases**: Unlocks DeFi opportunities for assets that lack native smart contract capabilities.

### Cons

- **Trust in Custodians**: Custodial models require faith in the entities managing reserves.

- **Complexity**: Introducing additional layers can complicate transactions and increase risks.

- **Smart Contract Risks**: Vulnerable to bugs or exploits in non-custodial implementations.

- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: Potential for increased scrutiny due to cross-chain and custodial activities.

## Broader Relevance

### Global Impact

Wrapped tokens play a vital role in unifying blockchain ecosystems, enabling global financial participation. By bridging the gap between major blockchains, they facilitate liquidity flows, accelerate DeFi adoption, and promote innovation in financial services.

### Adoption Examples

- **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)**: Bridges Bitcoin’s liquidity to Ethereum’s DeFi platforms.

- **Wrapped Ether (WETH)**: Standardizes ETH for compatibility with ERC-20 token contracts.

- **Wrapped Binance Coin (WBTC on Ethereum)**: Allows [Binance Smart Chain assets ](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/bep20-token/)to interact with Ethereum’s DeFi protocols.

## Controversies

Wrapped tokens often face criticism for their reliance on centralized custodians, which contradict the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. Additionally, regulatory concerns arise when custodians operate without clear oversight. Smart contract-based wrapped tokens mitigate some risks but introduce vulnerabilities from coding flaws and exploits.

## Analogy

Wrapped tokens are like gift cards for a specific store that can be used in a larger shopping mall. While they represent the value of the original store’s currency, they allow you to shop at multiple outlets in the mall.

## Conclusion

Wrapped tokens are a cornerstone of blockchain interoperability, enabling assets to traverse ecosystems and unlock their full potential. While challenges such as custodial trust and regulatory scrutiny remain, their role in bridging blockchains and expanding DeFi opportunities cannot be overstated. As blockchain technology evolves, wrapped tokens will continue to enhance accessibility, liquidity, and innovation in the digital economy.
