### Analogies

Imagine the financial system as a vast electrical grid powering an entire country. Before the Dodd-Frank Act, this grid was prone to blackouts due to outdated infrastructure and lack of oversight, affecting millions. The Dodd-Frank Act then represents a comprehensive upgrade to the grid's infrastructure, introducing rigorous safety standards, constant monitoring for faults, and mechanisms to prevent the entire system from going down if one part fails. This ensures a more stable and reliable power supply, much like how the act aims to provide stability and reliability in the financial system.
