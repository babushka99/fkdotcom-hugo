### TL;DR:

Fei Chien, also known as “flying money,” is an ancient Chinese system for informal money transfers. Developed during the Tang dynasty, it allowed merchants to send money across long distances without carrying physical cash, reducing the risks of theft or loss. Fei Chien operates on trust and personal networks, similar to the [Hawala system](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/payments-wiki/hawala-transfer/), and is still relevant in modern times through underground banking channels. Though it offers speed and efficiency, it raises regulatory concerns due to its lack of documentation and potential for misuse in illegal activities like money laundering.

### Executive Summary:

It is an informal money transfer system that originated in China during the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The name translates to “flying money,” reflecting the ease and speed with which funds could be transferred over long distances. Merchants and traders used Fei Chien to avoid the risks associated with transporting cash on dangerous trade routes. The system relies on trusted intermediaries who facilitate transfers based on personal reputation rather than formal contracts. Although it has evolved over time, similar informal financial networks persist today, particularly in underground banking. While it supports financial inclusion and quick transactions, it also presents regulatory challenges by operating outside formal banking systems.

## Fei Chien: A Detailed Overview

### Definition and Concept

Fei Chien, meaning "flying money," refers to an informal money transfer system that emerged during the Tang dynasty in China. It was created as a solution for merchants and traders who needed to transfer money securely across vast distances without physically carrying cash. In practice, Fei Chien allowed a merchant in one city to pay another merchant by issuing a letter or note, which could be redeemed by a trusted agent in a different location.

This system resembles modern-day money transfer services and is considered a precursor to formal banking. However, Fei Chien operates outside regulated financial systems and depends on personal trust rather than legal documentation, making it an early example of informal banking.

### How Fei Chien Works

- **Issuing the Transfer:**

A merchant deposits money with a trusted agent or intermediary in their local area.

- **Communication:**

The agent issues a letter or informal note specifying the amount to be paid and sends instructions to a counterpart agent in the destination city.

- **Payout:**

The counterpart agent delivers the agreed amount to the recipient without requiring physical cash to travel across the trade route.

- **Settlement Between Agents:**

Agents settle their accounts later, often through the exchange of goods, future transactions, or barter agreements.

### Key Characteristics of Fei Chien

- **Trust-Based System:** The entire system relies on trust between agents and merchants rather than formal contracts.

- **Fast and Secure:** Transfers are completed quickly, reducing the risk of theft during travel.

- **Minimal Documentation:** Transactions are recorded informally, often with verbal agreements or symbolic notes.

- **Cashless Transfers:** No physical cash is moved; the value is transferred through a network of trusted agents.

### Comparison with Modern Systems

Fei Chien has similarities with other informal systems, such as Hawala in the Middle East and South Asia. Both systems rely on personal networks, operate without government oversight, and offer fast, low-cost transactions. While Fei Chien originated in China, it shares the same principles found in various underground banking systems worldwide.

### Benefits of Fei Chien

- **Speed and Efficiency:**

Transactions are completed quickly, often within a day, even across long distances.

- **Reduced Risk:**

Merchants avoid the dangers of carrying cash, especially on routes prone to theft.

- **Financial Inclusion:**

Fei Chien provided access to [financial services for merchants and traders in remote regions](https://faisalkhan.com/learn/payments-wiki/what-is-financial-inclusion/).

- **Low Transaction Costs:**

### Risks and Challenges of Fei Chien

- **Lack of Regulation:**

Fei Chien operates outside formal financial systems, making it difficult for authorities to monitor or control.

- **Money Laundering Risks:**

Like other informal systems, Fei Chien can be exploited for illegal activities.

- **No Legal Protection:**

Participants have no legal recourse if an intermediary defaults or the funds go missing.

- **Dependence on Trust:**

The entire system relies on trust, and a breakdown in relationships can disrupt operations.

### Modern Usage of Fei Chien and Similar Systems

Although Fei Chien in its traditional form no longer exists, its principles continue in modern underground banking networks. Informal financial systems based on trust and undocumented transfers persist in many parts of Asia and among Chinese diaspora communities worldwide. These systems are especially common in areas where formal banking services are limited or expensive.

Fei Chien also shares features with systems like:

- **Hawala (Middle East, South Asia):** [Trust-based money transfers without official records](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/h/hawala-transfer/).

- **Hundi (India, Pakistan):** Informal promissory notes for trade and credit.

- **Phei Kwan (Thailand, Myanmar):** Informal money networks used by migrants and traders.

### Example of Fei Chien in Action

- **Ancient Chinese Merchant Transaction:**

A silk merchant in Xi’an deposits money with a local Fei Chien agent and receives a letter of transfer. The merchant sends the letter with a caravan to Beijing, where a counterpart agent delivers the equivalent amount to the recipient on arrival.

- **Modern-Day Parallel:**

A Chinese migrant in Southeast Asia uses an informal network to send remittances home. A trusted intermediary receives the money locally, and an agent in China delivers the amount to the family without passing through formal banking channels.

### Conclusion

Fei Chien, or "flying money," is a testament to the ingenuity of ancient Chinese merchants in developing an efficient, trust-based financial system. It not only served as a practical solution for long-distance trade but also laid the foundation for modern informal banking networks. While Fei Chien provided financial inclusion and reduced risks for merchants, it also created challenges for authorities by operating outside regulatory frameworks. The system's legacy lives on through underground banking networks worldwide, demonstrating the enduring value of informal financial solutions in the face of evolving economic needs.
