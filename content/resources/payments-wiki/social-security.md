## Definition and Origin

Social security is a government program designed to provide financial assistance to individuals during retirement, disability, or upon the death of a primary wage earner, ensuring a basic level of sustenance. The concept originated in the late 19th century, with the first modern social security program implemented in Germany under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1889. Since then, social security systems have evolved and expanded globally, adapting to the changing demographics and economic conditions of each country.
