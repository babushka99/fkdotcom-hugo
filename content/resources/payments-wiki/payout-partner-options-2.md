## Introduction to Payout Partner Options

Payout Partner Options involve selecting financial entities that help businesses execute payment disbursements in a specific country. These partners ensure that funds reach their destination while adhering to legal and regulatory standards.

### Origins and Backstory

The concept of payout partnerships has evolved with the globalization of trade and finance:

- **Early Banking Networks**: In the past, cross-border payments relied on correspondent banking networks, where banks established relationships with one another to facilitate international transactions.

- **Rise of Remittance Services**: With increased migration and international trade, dedicated [Money Services Businesses (MSBs)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/m/money-services-business-msb/) emerged to simplify the transfer process.

- **Digital Transformation**: The advent of fintech companies revolutionized payout options, offering faster and cheaper solutions like mobile wallets and digital payment systems.

### How to Choose the right Payout Partner?

When evaluating a payout partner, it's important to understand your options:

#### Existing Arrangements

- Your [solution provider](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/s/solution-provider/), who offers licensed coverage in the United States, may already be partnered with a payout partner through a correspondent agreement.

- This agreement is with a payout partner in the country of the beneficiary.

- If the rates offered by this payout partner are satisfactory, you can proceed with this arrangement.

#### Seeking Alternative Payout Partners

- If the rates or the payout partner itself is not to your liking (e.g., they are a competitor), you may want to find an alternative.

- The solution provider may or may not have an additional payout partner to suggest.

- If not, you have the option to introduce your own payout partner.

This could be a partner you’re already working with or you may opt to become a payout partner yourself.

- To establish this, you must undergo [enhanced due diligence](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/e/enhanced-due-diligence-edd/) with the solution provider and sign a correspondent agreement to become an official payout partner.

#### Transitional Arrangements

- A temporary solution is to continue using the solution provider's current payout partner.

- Meanwhile, you can work on setting up your own payout partner arrangements.

- Once your own arrangements are ready, you can transition to your chosen payout partner.

In summary, the three main options are:

- **Use the Solution Provider's Payout Partner**: Accept the existing payout partner’s rates and services.

- **Introduce Your Own Payout Partner**: If unsatisfied with the existing partner, propose an alternative, which may involve your own resources or a new partner after completing due diligence.

- **Transition Plan**: Utilize the current payout partner temporarily while preparing to switch to your own partner once arrangements are finalized.
