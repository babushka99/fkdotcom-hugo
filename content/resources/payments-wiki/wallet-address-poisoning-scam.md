## Definition of Wallet Address Poisoning Scam

The **Wallet Address Poisoning Scam** is a [cryptocurrency](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/cryptocurrency/) fraud scheme where attackers generate wallet addresses that closely resemble legitimate ones. They then send small transactions to the victim’s wallet, causing the fraudulent address to appear in their transaction history. If the victim mistakenly copies and pastes this address in future transactions, they send funds to the scammer instead of the intended recipient.

## Background / Backstory on Wallet Address Poisoning Scam

As cryptocurrency adoption has increased, so have sophisticated scams. Wallet address poisoning emerged as a direct response to the common practice of copying and pasting long, complex wallet addresses for transactions. Scammers rely on minor human errors, rather than hacking or malware, to steal funds. This method became more prevalent with the rise of [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/decentralized-finance-defi/) and [peer-to-peer (P2P)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/p/peer-to-peer-p2p/) transactions, where users frequently interact with multiple wallet addresses.

### How Wallet Address Poisoning Scam is Used in the Industry Today

- **Targeting High-Volume Users**: Scammers often target users who conduct frequent crypto transactions, such as traders, businesses, and DeFi participants.

- **Poisoning Transaction Histories**: By sending dust transactions (tiny amounts of cryptocurrency), scammers place their fake addresses in the victim’s recent transactions.

- **Exploiting Human Error**: Since many users quickly copy and paste wallet addresses, a slight similarity can cause them to select the wrong address.

- **Affecting Various Blockchains**: This scam is not limited to a single blockchain and can occur in Ethereum, Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, and others.

### How Does Wallet Address Poisoning Scam Work? (With Examples)

#### Example 1: Individual User Scam

- A user frequently transfers [USDT](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/u/usdc/) to their savings wallet.

- A scammer generates a wallet address similar to the user’s savings wallet.

- The scammer sends a small transaction (e.g., $0.0001 USDT) to the user’s main wallet.

- When the user later copies their savings wallet address from recent transactions, they may mistakenly select the scammer’s address.

- The user unknowingly sends their funds to the scammer.

#### Example 2: Business Payment Interception

- A business regularly pays suppliers in cryptocurrency.

- A scammer sends a dust transaction with a lookalike wallet address.

- An employee, copying the payment address from previous transactions, mistakenly uses the scammer’s address.

- The funds are sent to the scammer, resulting in financial loss.

## Simple Analogy

Imagine you frequently send mail to your friend at "1234 Maple St." A scammer learns this and starts sending you fake letters from "1234 Maple Ave." If you aren’t paying attention and reply to the fake address, your letter never reaches your friend but goes to the scammer instead.

## ELI5 (Explain Like I’m 5)
