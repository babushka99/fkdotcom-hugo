### Definition and Origin

Islamic Banking, also known as Sharia-compliant banking, is a banking system that operates in accordance with the principles of Sharia, the legal framework within Islam. This form of banking emphasizes the prohibition of interest (riba), which is considered [usury](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/i/interest/usury/) and exploitative under Islamic law. Instead, Islamic banking focuses on profit and loss sharing, asset-based financing, and ethical investments that promote social and economic development. The origin of Islamic Banking can be traced back to the 7th century, with modern implementations emerging in the late 20th century. It has evolved from niche markets in Muslim countries to a significant global financial sector, offering a wide range of financial products and services that comply with Islamic law.

### Usage Context and Evolution

Islamic Banking is typically utilized in scenarios where individuals or businesses seek [financial services](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/financial-services/) that align with Islamic ethical standards. This includes savings accounts, home and business financing, insurance (Takaful), and investment opportunities, all structured to avoid interest. Over the years, the application of Islamic Banking has broadened, integrating with global finance through Islamic bonds (Sukuk), Islamic funds, and even Islamic microfinance, indicating a significant shift towards inclusive financial practices that cater to ethical considerations.

### Importance and Impact

### Key Stakeholders and Users
