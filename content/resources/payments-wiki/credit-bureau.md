## **Definition and Origin**

A Credit Bureau is an organization that collects and aggregates information on individuals' and businesses' credit histories, including loans, credit cards, and payment behaviors, from various sources such as banks, credit card companies, collection agencies, and governments. Originating in the 19th century, credit bureaus were initially small, local firms that gathered information on the creditworthiness of customers. Over time, they evolved into sophisticated, global entities utilizing advanced technology to collect and analyze vast amounts of financial data, significantly impacting lending and borrowing practices worldwide.

## **Usage Context and Evolution**

However, their role has expanded to include risk assessment for insurance, employment screening, and tenant vetting. The evolution of digital technology has transformed their operations, enabling real-time data analysis and global data sharing, thus broadening their influence across the financial sector.
