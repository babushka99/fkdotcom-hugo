## Brief Definition and Origin

A **scammer** is an individual or group that **intentionally deceives others for personal, financial, or digital gain** through [fraudulent](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/fraud/) schemes or manipulative tactics. They exploit trust, urgency, fear, greed, or emotional vulnerability to trick victims into giving up money, personal data, or access to secure systems.
