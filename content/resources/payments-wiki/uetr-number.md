## Brief Definition and Origin of UETR Number

**UETR Number** stands for Unique End-to-End Transaction Reference. It is a unique identifier assigned to each cross-border payment transaction to track its journey from initiation to completion. The UETR number was introduced as part of the [SWIFT](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/s/swift-wire-trace/) GPI (Global Payments Innovation) initiative, aiming to improve transparency, traceability, and speed in international payments.

## Current Usage and Importance of UETR Number
