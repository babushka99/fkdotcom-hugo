## A Detailed Overview

### Definition and Concept

**Local acquiring** is a payment method where a business partners with an acquiring bank or payment processor within the same country or region as its customers. In payment processing, an acquiring bank (or acquirer) is the financial institution that processes credit and [debit card](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/debit-card/) payments on behalf of a merchant. By working with a local acquirer, businesses can handle payments in the local currency, avoid cross-border fees, and improve transaction approval rates.

In essence, local acquiring allows companies to process payments "locally" in each target region, rather than routing payments through international channels. This setup is beneficial for businesses that serve customers in multiple countries, as it enhances the payment experience for local customers and reduces processing costs.
