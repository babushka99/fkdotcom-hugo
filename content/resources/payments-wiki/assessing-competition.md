## Definition 
Assessing competition refers to the comprehensive process of evaluating the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) posed by competitors within a particular industry or market. In the context of the banking and financial services industry, this assessment enables organizations to make informed strategic decisions, improve service offerings, and tailor marketing efforts to effectively compete in a dynamic landscape.

## Background / Backstory 
In the ever-evolving world of business, understanding competition is paramount. Over the past few decades, the banking and finance sectors have become increasingly crowded, with numerous players entering the market. Traditional banks now compete with [fintech startups](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/fintech/), brick-and-mortar establishments with online platforms, and established financial institutions that are branching out into new territories. As a result, assessing competition has become a vital strategy for businesses aiming to stay relevant and thrive.

## How is Assessing Competition Used in the Industry Today
Today, businesses in the banking and finance industry leverage assessing competition as a strategic tool to gain insights into market dynamics. For [retail banking](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/banking/), firms explore how competitors structure product offerings like loans and mortgages, while personal finance platforms analyze peer services to optimize their features. Corporate banking applications examine institutional service providers to enhance customer relationships, and [payment processing](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/p/payment-processor/) firms assess emerging fintech competitors for new technologies.

## How Assessing Competition Works
To illustrate how assessing competition works, consider two examples:

- Retail Bank SWOT Analysis: A traditional retail bank might conduct a SWOT analysis on a competing online bank.

Strengths: Lower fees, advanced technology, high customer satisfaction.
- Weaknesses: Lack of physical branches, lesser-known brand.
- Opportunities: Expanding customer base among tech-savvy individuals.
- Threats: Rapid advancements in technology offering threats from smaller fintech firms.

- Payment Processor Benchmarking: A payment processing company compares itself to competitors.

It tracks transaction speeds, fees, and customer support levels.
- By identifying weaker areas, the company can improve processes (for instance, enhancing customer service or reducing transaction fees) to capture a larger market share.

## ELI5
Imagine you have a box of toys, and you want to know which toy is the most fun to play with. First, you look at each toy's features: is it colorful, does it make noises, or can you play with it in different ways? This is like finding the strengths of each toy. Next, you see what they can’t do very well, like a toy that breaks easily is weak. Then, you think about how you might make the toys better or how you might play with them differently in the future. That’s how grown-ups assess competition in their businesses!
