## Executive Summary

- KYC Amortization is the concept of spreading out the cost of Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance over a customer's lifecycle.

- It helps regulated entities like banks, fintechs, and MSBs balance compliance costs with customer profitability.

- This approach supports scalability, cost control, and better decision-making when onboarding clients.

- Challenges include regulatory updates, uneven customer activity, and technological dependencies.

## Definition of KYC Amortization

KYC Amortization refers to the process of allocating or distributing the financial cost of performing [Know Your Customer (KYC)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/k/know-your-customer-kyc/) procedures over a period of time, typically aligned with the expected lifetime or value of the customer. KYC is a regulatory requirement for financial institutions and MSBs that includes verifying the identity, financial behavior, and risk level of customers. Amortizing the cost helps firms manage onboarding and compliance expenses more efficiently.

## Background / Backstory on KYC Amortization

Traditionally, KYC checks have been a high upfront cost for financial institutions, especially when onboarding high-volume but low-margin customers. These checks involve identity verification, documentation, risk assessment, and ongoing monitoring—each with associated expenses.

As digital finance and regulatory scrutiny have grown, firms began considering the concept of amortizing this cost—essentially treating KYC like an investment in customer onboarding, similar to how software development or infrastructure costs are treated in accounting. This allows for better financial planning, especially for fintechs and startups operating on thin margins.

## How KYC Amortization is Used in the Industry Today and Its Significance

KYC amortization is applied primarily in:

- **Fintech Platforms:** Many startups that onboard users in bulk (e.g., remittance or wallet apps) use this concept to justify customer acquisition cost over time.

- **Regulatory Cost Planning:** Institutions allocate part of their budget for compliance costs over longer periods based on predicted customer behavior.

- **Customer Segmentation:** It helps businesses decide how much to spend on verifying and onboarding customers based on their projected lifetime value.

Its significance lies in creating a financially sustainable approach to onboarding and compliance while still satisfying regulators.

## How Does KYC Amortization Work? (With Examples)

### Example 1: MSB KYC Cost Distribution

A US-based MSB spends $50 per user on KYC during onboarding. If they project the average customer will stay for 2 years and bring $25/year in net revenue, they amortize the cost as $25 per year over 2 years, effectively making the expense manageable on a per-year basis.

### Example 2: Wallet App KYC Tier Strategy

A [digital wallet](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/digital-wallet/) app categorizes users by transaction volume. For high-volume users, it performs full KYC immediately. For low-volume users, it performs a basic verification first and then amortizes the full KYC costs over time if the user becomes more active.

## Simple Analogy

Think of KYC like buying a gym membership for a friend. You pay a big fee upfront hoping they’ll use it regularly over time. If they stop coming after a week, you’ve wasted your money. But if they go consistently for a year, your investment makes sense. Amortizing KYC means expecting users to “stick around” long enough to make the upfront cost worthwhile.

## ELI5 (Explain Like I’m 5)

Imagine you buy a really expensive coloring book for a new friend. If you only play once, it’s a lot of money. But if you play with them every weekend, it feels like it was worth it. KYC amortization is about hoping your new friend sticks around long enough to make the coloring book worth it.
