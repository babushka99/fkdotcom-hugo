### Definition

Fraud refers to any deceptive practice or scheme used by an individual or entity to unlawfully obtain money, assets, or information from another by means of misrepresentation or trickery. It encompasses a wide range of illegal activities, including identity theft, credit card fraud, wire fraud, and investment scams.

### Usage Context

Fraud is encountered across all facets of the banking and financial industry. It can occur in online banking transactions, during credit or debit card processing, through the manipulation of financial markets, within insurance claims, and across the spectrum of cryptocurrency transactions. Fraudulent activities also intersect with compliance and anti-money laundering (AML) efforts, as these are designed to detect and prevent illegal financial transactions.

### Importance

Fraud prevention and detection are critically important in the financial sector for several reasons. Firstly, they protect consumers and businesses from financial loss. Secondly, they preserve the integrity of the financial system, maintaining user trust and confidence. Thirdly, they ensure compliance with laws and regulations designed to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. Lastly, minimizing fraud helps to reduce operational costs for financial institutions.

### Users

The primary entities involved in dealing with fraud include financial institutions (banks, credit unions, card issuers), payment service providers, regulatory bodies (like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in the U.S.), law enforcement agencies, businesses of all sizes, and consumers. Technology companies providing security and fraud detection solutions also play a key role.
