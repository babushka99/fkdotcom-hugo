## Brief Definition and Origin Regulated Liability Network (RLN)

A **Regulated Liability Network (RLN)** is a **proposed financial infrastructure** that enables **real-time, cross-border, interoperable payments using tokenized liabilities** (such as bank deposits and central bank money), all within a **shared, [permissioned blockchain](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/p/permissioned-blockchain/) framework**. RLNs aim to modernize payment systems by **connecting regulated financial institutions**‚Äîlike commercial banks, central banks, and payment service providers‚Äîon a **unified digital ledger**.

The concept of an RLN was first introduced in a whitepaper co-authored by **Citigroup, HSBC, Mastercard, Wells Fargo, and the New York Innovation Center (part of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York)** in late **2022**, as part of a **12-week proof-of-concept pilot**. The goal was to explore how tokenized money and digital liabilities could operate in a **multi-asset, regulated environment**‚Äîbridging the gap between traditional finance and emerging digital systems.

## Explain Like I‚Äôm 5 (ELI5)

Imagine if **every bank in the world used the same super-fast, secure notebook** to keep track of who owns what money‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs cash, a credit balance, or central bank money. That‚Äôs what the RLN wants to be: **a shared digital notebook for regulated money**, where everyone writes and reads in the same place, but only **trusted banks and regulators** have the keys.

## Purpose and Goals of Regulated Liability Network (RLN)

The Regulated Liability Network is designed to solve major challenges in today's payment ecosystem:

- Slow settlement speeds, especially across borders

- Lack of interoperability** **between banking systems

- Fragmentation between public and private money

- Security and compliance concerns in [digital assets](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/digital-assets/)

- Need for programmable money without sacrificing regulation or stability

## Key Features

| ****Feature**** | ****Description**** |
| **Regulated Access** | Only licensed financial institutions can issue and settle digital liabilities |
| **Multi-Asset Support** | RLNs can support central bank money, commercial bank deposits, and [tokenized assets](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/t/tokenization/) |
| **Permissioned Ledger** | Unlike public blockchains, access is restricted to verified, regulated entities |
| **Interoperability** | Connects different financial institutions under a common framework |
| **24/7 Settlement** | Enables near-instant, continuous settlement across borders |
| **Programmability** | Smart contracts can automate conditional payments, compliance, etc. |

## Stakeholders and Implementation

**Key stakeholders:**

- **Central banks**: Provide access to digital central bank money (e.g., CBDCs or reserves)

- **Commercial banks**: Issue tokenized deposits representing customer balances

- **Payment service providers**: Enable access and application-level services

- **Regulators and supervisors**: Oversee compliance, licensing, and systemic risk

- **Technology providers**: Deliver the underlying distributed ledger infrastructure

### How Regulated Liability Network (RLN) Works (Simplified):

- **A central bank and commercial banks** join the RLN and issue tokenized versions of their liabilities

- **End users (individuals or businesses)** transact using these tokenized deposits via front-end interfaces

- **The RLN settles transfers on-chain** in near real-time, while maintaining compliance and security

- **Smart contracts** allow conditional or automated transactions (e.g., escrow, tax payments, etc.)

## Real-World Examples & Pilots

### üá∫üá∏ **United States: Regulated Liability Network ‚Äì US Proof-of-Concept (2022‚Äì2023)**

- **Led by**: Federal Reserve Bank of New York (NYIC), Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Mastercard, HSBC

- **Goal**: Simulate [digital dollar](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/digital-dollars/) transactions on a shared ledger

- **Result**: Demonstrated that digital liabilities can be settled on a unified ledger in near real-time, with potential for **domestic and cross-border scalability**

### üá¨üáß **United Kingdom: Project Rosalind**

- **Led by**: Bank of England and BIS Innovation Hub

- **Goal**: Explore the role of APIs in a CBDC system‚Äîcould integrate with RLNs in the future

- **Status**: Separate from RLN but conceptually aligned

### üåç **Project mBridge (International)**

- **Led by**: BIS, People's Bank of China, HKMA, and other central banks

- **Goal**: Cross-border CBDC interoperability

- **Relation**: mBridge is a **public-sector-only version** of what RLNs aim to do with both public and private sector integration

## Advantages vs. Disadvantages

| ****Aspect**** | ****Advantages**** | ****Disadvantages / Challenges**** |
| **Speed and Efficiency** | Real-time settlement; eliminates delays in cross-border transfers | Requires buy-in and infrastructure updates from multiple parties |
| **Regulatory Alignment** | Built for compliance from the ground up | Depends on coordination among regulators across jurisdictions |
| **Interoperability** | Connects central bank and commercial money in one framework | Complex to integrate with legacy banking systems |
| **Programmable Money** | Enables automation and smart contracts within legal limits | Raises questions about liability, legal enforceability |
| **Security and Trust** | Permissioned access ensures trust and compliance | Not as decentralized as public blockchains |

## Comparisons with Related Systems

| ****System**** | ****Key Differences from RLN**** |
| **SWIFT** | Message-based; not a settlement platform |
| **CBDCs** | Issued by central banks only; RLNs support private liabilities too |
| **Stablecoins** | Typically issued by private companies; RLNs are fully regulated |
| **Ripple / XRP Ledger** | Public blockchain with native token; RLNs use tokenized fiat on permissioned ledgers |
| **DeFi platforms** | Open and permissionless; RLNs are closed and institutionally controlled |

## Criticism and Open Questions About Regulated Liability Network (RLN)

- **Is RLN just a centralized blockchain?** Critics argue that [it lacks decentralization](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/centralized-vs-decentralized/), but defenders say **trust and compliance** are more important for systemic finance.

- **Will banks compete or collaborate?** The success of RLN depends on financial institutions working together, which is historically difficult.

- **Who governs the RLN?** Governance models are still under discussion‚Äîshould it be central banks, consortiums, or international bodies?

## Future Outlook

RLNs represent a **bridge between traditional finance and digital innovation**. As central banks roll out **CBDCs** and banks experiment with **tokenized deposits**, RLNs could become the **default infrastructure for digital money**, particularly for:

- **Cross-border payments**

- **Corporate treasury operations**

- **Real-time settlement of securities**

- **Tax and regulatory automation**

Expect further pilots in **Europe, Asia, and Latin America**, alongside global frameworks under development by the **Bank for International Settlements (BIS)** and the **Financial Stability Board (FSB)**.
