## Definition of Broker / Stockbroker

A broker, commonly referred to as a stockbroker in equity markets, is an individual or firm that acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers of financial securities. Brokers execute trades on behalf of clients, provide market insights, and sometimes offer investment advisory services. They are typically licensed by regulatory bodies such as the SEC (U.S.), FCA (UK), or SEBI (India) to ensure compliance with financial regulations.

## Background

The role of brokers dates back centuries, with early stock markets relying on intermediaries to facilitate transactions. Traditionally, investors had to go through full-service brokerage firms to access financial markets, often paying high fees for professional advice and trade execution. However, with the advent of electronic trading and online brokerage platforms in the 1990s, the industry shifted towards discount brokers that allow self-directed investors to trade at lower costs. Today, many brokers offer commission-free trading, robo-advisory services, and algorithmic trading tools to meet the evolving demands of retail and institutional investors.
