"KYC," or Know Your Customer, is a standard practice in the banking and business world that involves understanding the identity and nature of customers' activities to mitigate risks related to money laundering, terrorism financing, and other financial crimes. Different jurisdictions may have varying regulations and guidelines regarding KYC processes, but the core principle remains the same: to verify the identity of customers and understand their transaction behaviors.

### Light KYC

"Light KYC" refers to a simplified or reduced version of the standard KYC process. It typically involves collecting and verifying less customer information compared to the full KYC process. Light KYC might be applicable in certain contexts, such as:

- **Low-risk scenarios:** When the customer is perceived to present a lower risk of engaging in illicit financial activities, a light KYC might be sufficient.

- **Low transaction limits:** Some jurisdictions allow light KYC for accounts or transactions that are limited to a certain amount, under the assumption that these pose a lower risk.

- **Initial stages:** Sometimes, light KYC might be used during the initial stages of customer onboarding, with the understanding that full KYC will be completed at a later stage or when the customer wants to engage in higher-value transactions.

### Regular KYC

Regular or "full" [KYC](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/k/know-your-customer-kyc/) typically involves a comprehensive process of customer identification and verification. This might include:

- **Identity verification:** Checking official documents like passports, driving licenses, or other government-issued IDs.

- **Address verification:** Confirming the customer's residential address using utility bills, bank statements, or other official documents.

- **Understanding customer behavior:** Analyzing transaction patterns and understanding the nature of the customer’s business or personal financial activities.

- **Risk assessment:** Evaluating the potential risks associated with a customer, based on their profile, transaction patterns, and other relevant factors.

- **Continuous monitoring:** Regularly reviewing customer profiles and transaction behaviors to identify any unusual or suspicious activities.

### Differences between Light KYC and Regular KYC

- **Depth of Information:**

**Light KYC:** Collects minimal customer information and performs basic identity verification.

- **Regular KYC:** Involves a thorough collection and verification of customer information and documents.

- **Applicability:**

**Light KYC:** May be applied in low-risk scenarios or for accounts with lower transaction limits.

- **Regular KYC:** Is generally mandatory for all customers, especially those engaged in high-value or international transactions.

- **Risk Management:**

**Light KYC:** Might be considered sufficient for managing risks in certain low-risk contexts.

- **Regular KYC:** Provides a more robust framework for managing a wide range of risks associated with financial transactions.

- **Compliance:**

**Light KYC:** May be compliant with regulatory requirements in specific scenarios, such as low-value transactions or certain types of accounts.

- **Regular KYC:** Is typically required to ensure compliance with broader regulatory requirements related to [anti-money laundering (AML)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/a/anti-money-laundering-aml/) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT).

- **Customer Due Diligence (CDD):**

**Light KYC:** Involves basic [CDD](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/c/customer-due-diligence-cdd/) processes.

- **Regular KYC:** Involves standard or enhanced CDD, depending on the customer’s risk profile.

It's crucial to note that the specific requirements for light KYC and regular KYC can vary significantly between different jurisdictions and regulatory frameworks. Always refer to the relevant local and international regulations to ensure that KYC processes are compliant with all applicable laws and guidelines.
