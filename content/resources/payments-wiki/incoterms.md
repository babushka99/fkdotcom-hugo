## **Understanding Incoterms in Banking, Finance, Payments, and Trade**

## Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of global trade, Incoterms play a pivotal role in streamlining international transactions. They are a set of pre-defined commercial terms published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and are widely used in international commercial transactions or procurement processes. The term "Incoterms" is an abbreviation for "International Commercial Terms."

## Definition and Purpose

Incoterms are essentially a series of three-letter trade terms related to common contractual sales practices. They are primarily used to clearly communicate the tasks, costs, and risks associated with the transportation and delivery of goods. Incoterms specify who is responsible for paying for and managing the shipment, insurance, documentation, customs clearance, and other logistical activities.

### Who Issues and Uses Incoterms?

The International Chamber of Commerce, a global business organization with a broad reach, issues Incoterms. These terms are used by exporters, importers, lawyers, transporters, insurers, and others involved in international trade. They provide clarity and predictability to participants in global trade.

### **Examples of Incoterms**

- **EXW (Ex Works):** Under EXW, the seller makes the goods available at their premises, and the buyer incurs all costs and risks involved in taking goods from the seller's premises to the desired destination.

- **FOB (Free On Board):** FOB means the seller bears all costs and risks until the goods are loaded on board a vessel chosen by the buyer.

- **CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight):** Here, the seller pays the costs and freight to bring the goods to the port of destination. However, the risk is transferred to the buyer once the goods are loaded on the ship.

- **DDP (Delivered Duty Paid):** The seller is responsible for delivering the goods at the place of the buyer, and bears all risks and costs, including duty.

- **FCA (Free Carrier):** The seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, to the carrier selected by the buyer at the specified location.

### **Real-World Examples of Incoterms Use**

- **Example of FOB in Agriculture Export:** A U.S. grain producer sells to a buyer in Spain under FOB terms. The seller is responsible for transporting the grain to the port of loading in the U.S. and loading it onto the ship. Once the grain is loaded, the buyer in Spain takes responsibility for the sea transportation, insurance, and unloading at the destination port.

- **Example of CIF in Manufacturing Export:** An Indian machinery manufacturer sells to a client in Brazil under CIF terms. The seller is responsible for covering the cost, insurance, and freight to transport the machinery to the Brazilian port. The risk transfers to the buyer once the machinery is loaded onto the ship in India.
