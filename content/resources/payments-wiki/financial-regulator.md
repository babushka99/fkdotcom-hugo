A financial regulator is a government or independent agency responsible for overseeing the [financial services](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/financial-services/) industry in a particular jurisdiction. Their main objective is to ensure the stability, transparency, and integrity of financial markets and protect consumers of financial products and services.

The authority to establish a financial regulator and its powers is typically granted by the government of a country through legislation. The specific laws and regulations governing financial regulators vary from country to country, but most have the power to supervise financial institutions, enforce compliance with regulations, and impose penalties for violations.

Regulators are governed by boards or committees composed of industry experts, government officials, and public representatives. The specific composition of these boards and the way they are appointed can vary, but the overall goal is to ensure that the regulator is independent, impartial, and accountable to the public.

Financial regulators typically govern a wide range of [financial institutions](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/financial-institution-fi/), including banks, insurance companies, securities firms, and money services businesses. They have the power to supervise these institutions, enforce regulations, and take enforcement actions when necessary. This can include imposing fines, revoking licenses, and requiring corrective action.

Examples of financial regulators include:
