## Brief Definition and Origin

A **fraudster** is a person who **intentionally deceives others** through lies, manipulation, or misrepresentation in order to **gain financial, material, or informational advantage**. Fraudsters engage in **illegal or unethical acts of fraud**, often hiding behind fake identities, forged documents, or misleading narratives.

The term comes from the root word **“[fraud](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/f/fraud/)”**, derived from the Latin *fraus*, meaning deceit or injury. While the label "fraudster" traditionally referred to swindlers and con artists in the physical world, today it commonly describes individuals behind **cybercrime, financial scams, online deception, and large-scale fraud operations**.
