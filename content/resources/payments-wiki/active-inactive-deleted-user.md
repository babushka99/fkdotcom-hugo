### Active User

**Definition**: An active user is an individual or entity that regularly engages with a service, platform, or product within a specified time frame.

**Characteristics**:

- **Frequency of Interaction**: Regular interaction, like daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the context.

- **Engagement**: They perform actions such as logging in, making transactions, or interacting with content.

- **Recent Activity**: Their last activity is within the defined active period set by the service.

### Dormant User

**Definition**: A dormant user is an individual or entity that has an account or subscription with a service or platform but has not engaged with it for a significant period, exceeding the threshold for active use.

**Characteristics**:

- **Lack of Recent Activity**: They have not logged in, interacted, or made transactions for a duration that surpasses the active period.

- **Still Registered**: Despite inactivity, their account remains open and not deleted.

- **Potential for Reactivation**: They can become active users again if they resume interaction.

### Historic/Deleted User

**Definition**: A historic or deleted user is an individual or entity whose account or subscription has been terminated, either through user-initiated deletion or by the service provider, often after a prolonged period of dormancy.

**Characteristics**:

- **Account Closure**: Their account is no longer active or accessible.

- **Data Status**: Depending on the platform's policy, their data might be archived (historic) or permanently deleted.

- **No Current Interaction**: They can no longer interact with the service in any form under the deleted account.

### Contextual Variations

- **Time Frames**: The specific time frames defining these categories can vary significantly depending on the nature of the service. For instance, a social media platform might consider a user dormant after 30 days of inactivity, while a financial service might have a longer threshold.

- **Policy and Regulation**: Different platforms and industries have varying policies and regulations, especially regarding data retention and deletion, which influence how these terms are applied.
