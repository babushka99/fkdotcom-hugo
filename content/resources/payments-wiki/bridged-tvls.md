## Definition

**Bridged TVLs (Total Value Locked)** refer to the total amount of cryptocurrency assets locked in cross-chain bridges, which enable the transfer of tokens between different blockchain networks. These bridges act as connectors, allowing users to move assets from one blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) to another (e.g., Binance Smart Chain) seamlessly.

## Background / Backstory on Bridged TVLs

The concept of Bridged TVLs emerged with the rise of **[Layer 1 blockchains](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/b/blockchain/layer-1-in-bitcoin-blockchain/)** (like Ethereum and Bitcoin) and **Layer 2 blockchains** (like Polygon and Arbitrum). As the crypto ecosystem expanded, users needed ways to transfer assets across chains without relying on centralized exchanges. Cross-chain bridges were developed to solve this problem, and Bridged TVLs became a key metric to measure the liquidity and activity of these bridges.

## How is Bridged TVLs Used in the Industry Today?

Bridged TVLs are crucial in **Decentralized[ Finance (DeFi)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/d/decentralized-finance-defi/)**, **dApps**, and **cross-chain ecosystems**. They enable users to:

- Access diverse DeFi platforms across multiple blockchains.

- Participate in staking, swaps, and yield farming on different networks.

### How Does It Work?

- **Step 1:** A user locks their tokens (e.g., ETH) in a bridge smart contract on the original blockchain.

- **Step 2:** The bridge mints an equivalent amount of [wrapped tokens](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/w/wrapped-tokens/) (e.g., WETH) on the destination blockchain.

- **Step 3:** The user can now use these wrapped tokens on the new blockchain for trading, staking, or other activities.

### Examples

- **Polygon Bridge:** Allows users to move assets from Ethereum to Polygon, reducing gas fees and enabling faster transactions.

- **Wormhole Bridge:** Facilitates asset transfers between Solana and Ethereum, expanding DeFi opportunities for users on both chains.

### Simple Analogy

Imagine you have a gift card (crypto asset) for Store A (Blockchain A), but you want to shop at Store B (Blockchain B). A bridge acts like a gift card exchange service that converts your Store A card into a Store B card, so you can spend it there. Bridged TVLs measure how much total money is being exchanged through this service.

## Stakeholders and Implementation

### Who Uses Bridged TVLs?

- **DeFi Users:** To access [yield farming](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/y/yield-farming/) and staking opportunities across chains.

- **Developers:** To build cross-chain dApps and services.

- **Investors:** To track liquidity and activity in the crypto ecosystem.

### Challenges

- **Security Risks:** Bridges are often targeted by hackers (e.g., the $600M Ronin Bridge hack).

- **Complexity:** Managing wrapped tokens and ensuring interoperability can be technically challenging.

## Pros & Cons

### Pros

- **Interoperability:** Enables seamless asset transfers between blockchains.

- **Liquidity Growth:** Increases liquidity across DeFi platforms.

- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces reliance on centralized exchanges.

### Cons

- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Bridges are prone to hacks and exploits.

- **Centralization Risks:** Some bridges rely on centralized custodians.

- **Regulatory Uncertainty:** Cross-chain transfers may face future regulatory scrutiny.

## Future Outlook

- **Emerging Trends:** Advances in [zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)](https://faisalkhanllc.xyz/resources/payments-wiki/z/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp/) and trustless bridges aim to enhance security and decentralization.

- **Predictions:** Bridged TVLs will grow as more Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains emerge, fostering a multi-chain future.
