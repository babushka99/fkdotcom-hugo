## US Money Transmitter License 101

#### Options available with respect to the US Money Transmitter License

**This page is NOT optimized for viewing on a mobile device.**

This document aims to provide you with a tl;dr (too long, didn’t read) version of all things [US Money Transmitter Licensing](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/).

There are quite a few options available for obtaining a [money transmitter license](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/) for your business needs in the United States. The US licensing regime is complicated, so we have tried to make it simple for you to understand your options. 

The United States does not have a single [money transmitter license](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/). One has to obtain a money transmitter license from each US state. So effectively, there are 49 money transmitter licenses (the exception being the State of Montana, which does not have a money transmitter license). The federal territory of Washington D.C. and the three US territories, namely: Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and Guam.

Detailed information regarding licensing for [US Cryptocurrency Regulations](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/us-cryptocurrency-regulation/) will be published on this page soon.

See the complete list of US State Regulators [here](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing-regulatory-coverage/us-money-transmitter-license/interactive-map-us-state-financial-regulators/):

On a federal level, there is registration required with [FinCEN](https://www.fincen.gov/), but do note that [FinCEN registration](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/resources-and-references/financial-crimes-enforcement-network-fincen/) is not a license. You can learn more about this in a clarification video I did [here](https://youtu.be/DESyiP1kb3I) and [here](https://youtu.be/LIt6msVlAWY). 

Please be acutely aware that there is **no** federal-level money transmitter licensing offering (other than getting a financial charter of a bank). 

### Summary Table for US States Money Transmitter License with Cost Breakdown

This is a detailed breakdown of the costs involved in filing for a new application with the State Regulator.

[US States Money Transmitter License with Cost Breakdown](https://faisalkhan.com/summary-table-for-us-states-money-transmitter-license-with-costs/ "Summary Table: US Money Transmitter License")

## So what are your options?

There are **four** ways to get regulatory coverage for [US Money Transmitter License](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/) if your business has been defined as a [Money Services Business](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-services-business-msb/).

To summarize them, they are listed below. Our company offers **all four** options as part of our service offering:

  1. **Apply** for your own money transmitter license with [each state regulator](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/list-of-us-state-financial-regulators/),
  2. Become an **[Agent](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transfer-agent/)** of an existing money transmitter license holder, 
  3. Find a sponsoring institution that can provide you with the necessary regulatory cover for your money transmitter license needs (essentially, you’re **Renting a License** , also called a [Sponsored License](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/sponsor/)), and lastly, 
  4. Enroll in a **White-Label Program** with an entity with a money transmitter license of their own.
