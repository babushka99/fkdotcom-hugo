## U.S. Virgin Islands Money Transmitter License Guide

A money transmitter license is mandatory by law before you can start operating in the Virgins Islands. 

If you fall under the[ definition of a money transmitter ](#money-transmitter-definition)as stated in the Virgin Islands code, then it is illegal for you to conduct business without a license unless you are an [authorized delegate](https://faisalkhan.com/services/money-transfer-license-money-transmitter-license/us-money-transmitter-license/own-money-transmitter-licenses-vs-authorized-delegate/) of a licensed money transmitter.
