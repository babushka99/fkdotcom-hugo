## Georgia Money Transmitter License - The Basics

Every money transmitter in Georgia MUST get a license by applying at the GA [NMLS](https://faisalkhan.com/knowledge-hub/resources-and-references/nmls-national-multistate-licensing-system/) if they want to operate in the state legally.

The process of applying for a money transmitter license in GA can be daunting due to its often complicated procedure, cumbersome paperwork, and seemingly endless documentation. But there is no way around it, is there?

Actually, there is. You can get [license coverage for your business](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing-regulatory-coverage/us-money-transmitter-license/us-money-transmitter-license-options/) quite conveniently and in a fraction of the time.

Remember, it is a crime to conduct any kind of money-moving activity without a license. In Georgia, any business or person who transmits money or monetary value is considered a money transmitter and therefore under a legal obligation to obtain a license.

> _Pursuant to the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.) §§ 7-1-680(13) and 7-1-681, any person (individual, sole proprietorship, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust, or any other group of individuals, however organized) that engages in transmission of money is required to obtain a Georgia Money Transmitter License._

## Who Regulates the Licensing for Georgia Money Transmitters?

While the application for a new money transmitter license is handled by the NMLS, the state authority that regulates money transmission businesses is the [Georgia Department of Banking and Finance](https://dbf.georgia.gov/).

## Checklist for MTL Application in Georgia

The NMLS has a handy [checklist](https://nationwidelicensingsystem.org/slr/PublishedStateDocuments/GA-Money-Transmitter-Company-New-App-Checklist.pdf) that contains all the information you will need for your license application. It includes detailed information about how to apply, the documents you will need, and other important factors. Make sure you read and understand everything on the site.

Another important website is the [state regulator’s money transmission page](https://dbf.georgia.gov/money-transmitters) which will also give you a proper definition of who is and is not a money transmitter in GA.

Our guide below will help you understand how the license application process works in Georgia and what you need to know.
