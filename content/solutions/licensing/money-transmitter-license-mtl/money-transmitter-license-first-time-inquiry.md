We offer two solutions that cater to different needs. As a licensing option in the United States, we have two choices- owning or leasing. It's worth mentioning that many people are not aware of the leasing option, which involves getting sponsored for a license. 

**PART A: Applying for Your Own Money Transfer License**  

If you're interested in applying for your own money transfer license, we've compiled essential information on the costs, requirements, and procedures involved. Please click on the links below to explore your options:

**PART B: Utilizing Remittance-as-a-Service (RaaS)**  

Alternatively, you may consider using our Remittance-as-a-Service (RaaS) solution, which allows you to be sponsored for a license in the U.S. without going through the lengthy application process yourself. It is important to note it includes banking, payment processing, licensing, compliance, reporting, and transaction monitoring, etc. 

**Please note: This is just one type of sponsorship we offer. We have many more. Please inquire within.**

Please note: RaaS solution offering is for Person-to-Person (P2P) transfers only. If you are seeking a B2C or B2B cross-border money transfer, then please contact us as we have a separate solution offering for that. 

Also note, in its current form, RaaS does not support cryptocurrency.
