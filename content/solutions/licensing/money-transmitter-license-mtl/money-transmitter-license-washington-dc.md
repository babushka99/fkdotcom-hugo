## Money Transmitter License in Washington DC - The Basics

Whether you're planning to start your money services business or expand your current money transmission business in Washington DC, you will have to apply for a money transmitter license.

According to [NMLS](https://dfi.wa.gov/sites/default/files/forms/mt-new-app-checklist.pdf), a company is required to acquire this license if they intend to carry out these two business activities: 

  1. Receive money or its equivalent value (equivalent value includes virtual currency) to transmit, deliver, or instruct to be delivered to another location, inside or outside the United States, by any means including but not limited to by wire, facsimile, or electronic transfer. 
  2. Sell, issue, or act as an intermediary for open-loop prepaid access and payment instruments. 

##  WA Money Transmitter License Regulator

The state regulator, [Washington State Department of Financial Institutions](https://dfi.wa.gov/) (DFI) regulates and examines a variety of state-chartered financial institutions. Whereas, money transmitters in Washington are regulated by the [Division of Consumer Services](https://dfi.wa.gov/industry/consumer-services). 

Details pertaining to the money transmission application process in Washington, such as the application form, laws, regulations and other resources can be accessed [here](https://dfi.wa.gov/money-services). 

In an effort to streamline the licensing process, [DFI ](https://dfi.wa.gov/money-services/licensing)now uses the [NMLS ](https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/)system for money transmitter license application. All licensed money transmitters are listed in the NMLS Consumer Access Database.

## WA Money Transmitter License Cost

The licensing application fee is US$ 1,000 and the initial NMLS processing fee is US$100. These are non-refundable. 

You might also need to hire a dedicated compliance officer through your licensing application process. This might cost you somewhere between US$ 70,000 to US$ 100,000 per year.

## WA Money Transmitter Net Worth 

According to DFI, the minimum required tangible net worth is US$ 10,000 for every one million dollars of money transmission. The maximum tangible net worth is US$ 3,000,000.

If you deal in virtual currency and store the same in wallets on behalf of others, the minimum required tangible net worth is US$ 100,000.

## WA Money Transmitter Surety Bond

According to the Washington State Department of Financial Institution, money transmitter licensees will be required to maintain a surety bond between US$ 10,000 and US$ 550,000. However, based on the financial condition of the licensee, the examiner might increase this amount to a maximum of US$ 1 million.
