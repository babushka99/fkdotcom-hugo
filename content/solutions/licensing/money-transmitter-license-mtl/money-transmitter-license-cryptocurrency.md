## Money Transmitter License for Cryptocurrency

The United States has varying rules and regulations for cryptocurrencies. While each state has its own regulatory authority and rules, most have classified cryptocurrency transmission services as money transmitters. 

FinCEN [published interpretive guidance](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20Guidance%20CVC%20FINAL%20508.pdf) for cryptocurrency service providers. The guidance clarified certain aspects of how crypto businesses are regulated under the same rules as applied to money services businesses in the US. For some bitcoin and crypto business models, it would be mandatory to obtain money transmitter licenses but not for all of them.
