# Indiana Money Transmitter License Overview

## Who Controls the Indiana Money Transmitter License

The [Indiana Department of Financial Institutions](https://www.in.gov/dfi/) issues a [Money Transmitter License](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/what-is-a-money-transmitter-license/) to any entity that engages in the business of selling or issuing payment instruments primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. Money transmissions performed by an entity from an office or place of business, or internet, wherever located (inside or outside the United States) by any means, including but not limited to a payment instrument, wire, facsimile, or electronic transfer would be considered money transmission activity.

All money transmitters, including an [authorized delegate](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/authorized-delegate-ad/), with an out-of-state location that engages in consumer-purpose money transmission activities with Indiana residents, are subject to the Indiana Money Transmitter Act and its licensing requirements. A physical presence, such as an office in Indiana and/or the use of Indiana agents or authorized delegates, is not a prerequisite for money transmission activity that requires licensure.
