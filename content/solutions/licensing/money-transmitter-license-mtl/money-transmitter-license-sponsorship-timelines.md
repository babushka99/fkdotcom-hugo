**Day 1:** We begin by signing the Referral Agreement and initiating the EDD Collection process, corporate setup, pay-in, and pay-out flows, correspondent tie-up agreements, and client types.

**Day 21:** After receiving sign-off from the client for the pre-introductory material, we introduce them to potential solution providers with approved information.

**Days 23-25:** We conduct an introductory call with the solution provider while maintaining non-disclosure.

**Day 30:** We directly engage with the solution provider and work on multiple facets such as contract negotiations, commercial terms, enhanced due diligence, technology/API, and flow of funds and transaction set.

**Day 75:** We sign the commercial terms after completing enhanced due diligence and agreeing on AML policies/compliance, sandbox access, and technology integration/build.

By now, the following activities would have been completed:

  * Enhanced Due Diligence
  * Acceptance of Commercial Terms and Signing of Contract
  * Agreement on AML Policies/Compliance
  * Sandbox Access
  * Technology Integration and Build

**Day 100:** All development build, integration, and testing are complete. We conduct a final walk-through/review with the solution provider before going live.

**Day 110:** We go live and launch the project.

Please note that while we aim to follow this timeline, we understand that flexibility may be required, and the timeline may be subject to +/- three weeks. Our team is dedicated to ensuring a successful outcome for our clients, and we will work closely with you to accommodate any changes that may arise.
