In the United States, whether remote bill presentment and payment (RBPP) services require a money transmitter license depends on the specifics of the service and how it's structured. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Understanding Money Transmitter Licenses

  1. **Definition** : A money transmitter license is a legal requirement for businesses that engage in the transfer of money or provide payment services. This is regulated both at the federal and state level.
  2. **Federal Regulation** : At the federal level, money transmitters must register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and comply with regulations like the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering (AML) laws.
  3. **State Regulation** : Each state has its own criteria for what constitutes money transmission and requires a separate license. The requirements vary widely from state to state.

### RBPP and Money Transmitter Licenses

  1. **Direct Payment Services** : If an RBPP service directly handles customer funds – for example, if it collects money from a customer and then pays it to a biller – it's more likely to be classified as a money transmission service. This would generally require a money transmitter license.
  2. **Bill Payment Through Financial Institutions** : If the RBPP service is merely facilitating payments through existing financial institutions (like banks) and doesn't directly handle the transfer of funds, it might not require a money transmitter license. In this case, the financial institution's licensing would cover the regulatory requirements.
  3. **Service Structure Matters** : The necessity for a license also depends on whether the RBPP service is acting as an intermediary in the payment process or just providing a technological platform for transactions.

### Examples

  * **Direct Handling of Funds** : An RBPP service that collects payments from users and then distributes these to various billers may be classified as a money transmitter.
  * **Payment Facilitation Only** : An online platform that simply facilitates the payment process by linking customers with their existing bank accounts for bill payments might not be considered a money transmitter.

### Conclusion

Whether an RBPP service in the U.S. requires a money transmitter license depends on the nature of its operations, particularly how it handles customer funds. It is advisable for businesses to consult with legal experts specializing in financial regulations to determine their specific licensing requirements. This ensures compliance with both state and federal laws, which is crucial in the heavily regulated financial services sector.
