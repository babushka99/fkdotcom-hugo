### Step by Step Guide to Getting a Massachusetts Money Transmitter License

  1. **Register with NMLS**

All MA money transmitter applications are processed online and you will have to create an account for your business before you proceed. Simply [go to the website](https://mortgage.nationwidelicensingsystem.org/slr/resources/Pages/GettingStartedStateMLO.aspx) and follow instructions.

  2. **Follow the checklist**

Use the [checklist](https://nationwidelicensingsystem.org/slr/PublishedStateDocuments/MA-Foreign-Transmittal-Agency-Company-New-App-Checklist.pdf) to gather and complete all the necessary documents that are required for the application. 

  3. **Complete MU1 form and other documents**

Download and complete the Company Form  
(MU1). You can find [filing instructions](https://mortgage.nationwidelicensingsystem.org/licensees/resources/LicenseeResources/Company%20\(MU1\)%20Form%20Filing%20Instructions.pdf) here.

  4. **Money transmitter license fee for MA**

2\. Investigation fee: $300 per license  
3\. Credit report fee: $15 per control person(s)  
4\. FBI criminal background check: $36.25 per owner(s) or control person(s)

  5. **Surety bond for Mass. MTL application**

A [surety bond](https://mortgage.nationwidelicensingsystem.org/news/Documents/ESB%20Adoption%20Map%20and%20Table.pdf) of $50,000 will need to be submitted electronically with your application. Keep in mind, this is only the bond for the initial license.

You could get your approval for a money transmitter license in 4 months if you are lucky. The usual wait time is six to eight months.

The whole process for applying for a license can be quite daunting and complicated especially if you are a new business. Perhaps the most prohibitive part of licensing is the expense - it is simply money that a fledgling business cannot afford. This is why many new businesses choose to go the route of quietly offering services without getting a license. 

Remember, this is illegal and you should [NEVER operate without a license](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/understanding-the-united-states-money-transmitter-licensing/unlicensed-money-transfer-what-to-do-next/).
