---# Bolivia - Addressing the US Dollar Shortage in Bolivia

## USD/USDT Cross-Border Payment Enablement

# **Overview**

Amidst Bolivia's severe dollar shortage, restrictive capital controls, and increasing reliance on informal financial channels, there is a pressing need for legitimate, efficient, and compliant pathways to move money across borders. Entrepreneurs, exporters, and importers alike are seeking mechanisms to bypass the limitations of the local banking system and access U.S. dollars for trade, payments, and capital preservation. This project responds directly to that need by offering a dual-structure payments and compliance framework that enables cross-border settlements via both traditional fiat and crypto rails (specifically USDT).

By combining regulated U.S.-based entities with offshore operational flexibility—backed by expert guidance and access to licensed providers—this solution creates an end-to-end model that is adaptable, fast to implement, and aligned with international financial compliance requirements. Whether the goal is to facilitate named account payments to U.S. vendors, or route payments to non-U.S. destinations such as China, Europe, or Latin America, this platform is built to scale with transparency, legality, and operational efficiency at its core.

# **Solution Architecture:**

This cross-border payment solution is structured around a dual-entity framework that enables legally compliant, operationally flexible payments from Bolivia to both U.S. and non-U.S. destinations, using either fiat or stablecoin rails. The structure is designed for B2B and high-value cross-border type payments.

## Flow of Funds

![Bolivia_Flow_of_Funds](/images/Bolivia_Flow_of_Funds.png)

## **Dual-Entity Model**

### **U.S. Entity (Regulated Pathway for U.S.-Bound Transactions)**

- **Legal Basis**: Operates under a Money Services Business (MSB) registration and is covered by a licensed Money Transmitter (MTL) through an agent sponsorship model.
- Functionality:
  - Receive USD via wire, USDT liquidation, or conversion
  - Settle named or unnamed payments to vendors across the United States
  - Maintain compliance logs and regulatory filings (e.g., SARs, CTRs) via sponsor
- Banking:
  - U.S. banking is provided via BaaS platform or sponsor's bank account
  - Dedicated sub-accounts for clients may be possible depending on sponsor

### **Non-U.S. Entity (Flexible International Settlement Path)**

- **Location**: Jurisdictions include Canada (preferred), Malta, Turkey, Panama, or UAE
- Functionality:
  - Facilitate transactions that do not touch the U.S. financial system
  - Receive funds via crypto or wire
  - Pay out to counterparties in China, Europe, LATAM, etc.
  - Avoid U.S.-specific regulatory requirements (e.g., FinCEN, OFAC)
- Banking:
  - Uses international multi-currency bank accounts or PSPs (Payment Service Providers)
  - USDT/USDC-compatible wallets may be custodial or self-hosted depending on risk appetite

## **Fund Flow Variants**

### **USD-Offshore Flow (Indirect Fiat Path)**

1. Importer in Bolivia pays a local exporter in BOB.
2. Exporter transfers equivalent USD from offshore account (e.g., in Switzerland).
3. Funds enter U.S. sponsor bank account or PSP wallet.
4. Sponsor entity disburses funds to U.S. beneficiary (e.g., vendor, service provider).

**Use Case**: Ideal for transactions where importer wants to pay a U.S. entity without going through Bolivia’s central bank.

### **Stablecoin Flow (USDT Path)**

1. Importer purchases USDT locally via Binance P2P or OTC desk or local preferred crypto exchange.
2. USDT is sent to solution provider’s wallet (U.S. or offshore).
3. USDT is liquidated into fiat (via exchange or OTC).
4. Fiat is delivered to the end vendor or credited to an IBAN or bank account.

**Use Case**: High speed, less dependency on correspondent banks, ideal for countries with currency controls.

### **Non-U.S. Routing Path (Cross-Border B2B)**

1. BOB is converted into crypto or routed through informal channels.
2. Non-U.S. entity receives USD/USDT and disburses payment to Europe, China, or LATAM.
3. Payment is made from Canadian, Maltese, or Turkish PSP account depending on geography.

**Use Case**: Used for payments from Bolivia to Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, etc. where U.S. regulation is unnecessary or undesirable.

## **Compliance Layer**

- U.S. Entity:
  - Covered under MTL licensing of sponsor
  - AML policies enforced by the sponsor
  - Monthly, quarterly reporting (dependent on state and FinCEN)
  - KYC/KYB managed via integrated onboarding partner (e.g., Alloy, SumSub)
- Non-U.S. Entity:
  - Follows local AML/KYC regulations (e.g., FINTRAC in Canada)
  - May use custodial or decentralized wallets depending on local law
  - Provides auditability, but no U.S. data-sharing requirement unless involved with U.S. banking

## **Technical Infrastructure Options**

- **Custody**: Hosted wallet providers, cold storage, or hybrid models (e.g., Fireblocks)
- **KYC Integration**: Document upload + sanctions screening
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Real-time rules engine for velocity, fraud, and sanctions triggers
- **Accounting**: Sub-account ledgering for reconciliation of inbound/outbound flows

## **Scalability Notes**

- Suitable for MVP starting at $500K/month
- Scales cleanly to $10M+/month with better pricing, vendor trust, and liquidity access
- Modular expansion: additional corridors can be layered with provider consent

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: Is this legal?**

Yes, provided the U.S. arm operates under an MSB registration and licensed MTL sponsor. The offshore arm adheres to the legal frameworks of its respective jurisdiction.

**Q2: What are the biggest risks?**

Operating without licensing in the U.S. can lead to jail time, asset seizure, or de-banking. Working under licensed structures eliminates this risk.

**Q3: Do we need a team in the U.S.?**

No. Operations can be conducted remotely, provided proper compliance protocols and sponsorship relationships are in place.

**Q4: Can this model support payments to countries outside the U.S.?**

Yes, using the non-U.S. entity. Ideal for routes into **China**, **Europe**, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela (for OFAC-exempt food trade), and all other LATAM markets including **Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Chile**.

**Q5: Where does the USD come from?**

From gold and silver exporters, remitters, and diaspora. Optionally, USDT can be purchased in-country and converted onshore.

**Q6: What kind of clients benefit most?**

Importers who need access to USD, exporters who receive offshore USD, and individuals looking to safeguard their savings or conduct cross-border trade.

**Q7: Is stablecoin use mandatory?**

No, but it is increasingly common in Bolivia. Stablecoins allow for faster, traceable settlements with reduced counterparty risk.

**Q8: What's the minimum viable volume?**

Roughly $2 million per month. Below that, the operating cost of compliance and sponsorship may outweigh the returns.

**Q9: Can you assist with setting up companies or bank accounts?**

Yes. We offer turnkey assistance with LLC/IBC formations, account opening, compliance onboarding, and flow structuring.

**Q10: What if the end vendor requires named payments?**

We support named accounts, allowing the U.S. payment to reflect the actual importer’s entity name—important for customs, invoices, and AML compliance.

**Q11: What does it take to access Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) infrastructure?**

Significant capital strength and customer base are required. Typically, providers expect:

- A community of at least **1,000 active accounts**

- Minimum cumulative deposits of **$2 million**

  Without this scale, BaaS providers may decline onboarding or offer only limited functionality.

**Q12: Can this evolve into a long-term financial platform post-crisis?**

Absolutely. There’s strong market demand for multi-currency wallets, digital debit cards, and the ability to store, send, and receive funds globally—bypassing fragile local banking systems. With the right setup, this operation can become a trusted alternative to traditional banking.

**Q13: Is there a way to start small and scale gradually?**

This is a common challenge. While Minimum Viable Product (MVP) models exist, the market sets baseline infrastructure expectations. For example, processing just $200K–$300K/month—even at a 2% spread—only yields $6K/month in gross revenue, which limits your operational capacity. The real advantages begin to emerge at $2M+/month in volume, where you gain access to better pricing, credibility, and system efficiencies.

**Q14: Will I need to get a surety bond?**

If you're acting as an agent under someone else's license, **you will not need to post your own surety bond**. However, if the sponsor requires an increase in bond coverage due to your transaction volume, **you may be asked to cover the incremental premium**.

**Q.15 What is the total initial investment required (licenses, structure, consulting, banks, tech, etc.)?**

- The pricing varies from solution provider to solution provider. Here are some approximate numbers for you:
- My consultancy fees (which is fixed), is US$ 15,000 of which, 50% is up-front and 50% is upon signing with the solution provider.
- The commercials for solution provider, you can see from Solution Provider Pricing (estimated commercials): https://faisalkhanllc.notion.site/Bolivia-USD-USDT-Project-239f149ceaef808eb60bfaf19452f1a6 (this has already been shared with you).
- From a company standpoint, you need to be liquid for US$ 125,000 (on average) to qualify for a sponsorship.
- Some licensed solution providers might even work with you, if your liquidity stands at US$ 75,000.Most solution providers will work on a funds good-and-settled model, so if any refunding is required, you are required to put up that prefunding.

**Q.16 I know you mentioned you are already working with a client from Bolivia. Has a compliance/legal review been done for Bolivia and the involved countries (AML, KYC, FX controls)?**

I'm not sure what you mean by a compliance/legal review. Review what? The licensed money services business, that holds the necessary money transmitters licenses, did their Enhanced Due Diligence with the Bolivian Partner that they are working with, (as required by law) and are in the midst of setting up their system so that their clients, (i.e. the clients of the Bolivian Partner), can be onboarded to have their accounts (this was a requirement from this particular Partner). Each business they are onboarding is being given a specialized clearing account in US Dollars as the end beneficiaries are asking that payments from these Bolivian customers come from a named account.

From an AML, KYB, and FX Controls points of view, let me comment as much as I can briefly on this subject.

- The AML controls that are in place, have nothing alarming, or rather no red-flag has gone off, with regards to this particular Partner and the customers that they are onboarding.
- From a KYB (Know Your Business) point of view, the documentation being provided, suffice the minimum standards that the Principal License Holder has, are being met.
- From an FX Control point of view. They are not concerned about that, as they are receiving USDT into their account, or US Dollars from outside of Bolivia, into their account to do either net-to-net or book-to-book settlement with their counterparts in Bolivia &/or settle, make payments as per the given instructions by the client.
- There is no case where US Dollars are being sent out of Bolivia, or that Bolivianos (BOB) are being shipped out of Bolivia.
- The PLH (Principal License Holder) is only working with countries they feel comfortable to work with, i.e. US, Canada, UK, EU (various), Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, China/HK, UAE to name a few.

**Q.17 What legal exposure do we face at each stage of the transaction flow?**

That is something for your lawyer to tell you. Not me, as you would be bound by a contract. If you are an Authorized Delegate, then you're in the Flow of Funds and are hence responsible for the transaction and its good execution.

If you are an API functionary, then you are not in the Flow of Funds, then the legal exposure is low, but never zero. The counterparty risk is high, as you do not control the flow of the transaction nor are in possession of the funds.

To work out the legal exposure at each stage of the transaction, you need to have a defined (signed off Flow of Funds), something like I have shared, and then an understanding of the model under which you are functioning.

**Q.18 How do we avoid regulatory risk (e.g., fund freezes, audits)?**

An Audit is not a regulatory risk, but rather part and parcel of doing business in a regulated world, so it should not be looked upon as something to avoid. Just wanted to clarify that. Funds freeze will happen because of one of three things (I'm being overly limited here, albeit the reasons can be many).

- Freezing of fund, because the funds are originating from a wallet or associated with a business or are going to a wallet or a business that is deemed flagged for some reason. We will never know the reason why it was flagged, just suffice to say, you would be informed that the funds have been frozen. This is rare.
- Funds are temporarily frozen, pending additional paperwork that is requested, once the paperwork has been provided and to the satisfaction of the institution that instituted the freeze, the funds are released. This can be anywhere from one week to as long as six months. There is no average. But if such a transaction freeze does happen, it is usually between 4 to 6 weeks. Clients sign up for this, i.e. they are knowledgeable and it is highlighted in the contract agreement that they sign.
- A court order. If for some reason a court order initiates a freeze or a government body, then the funds would be frozen and you may/may-not know about the reason behind the freeze. In most cases once the government freezes funds, they are hardly ever released, and if released it is a super involved process.

**Q.19 Is it legal for us to operate as financial intermediaries in this structure?**

Only if you are licensed as a financial intermediary or an agent/authorized delegate of one. You can also do the business without being a financial intermediary, but then you would not be in the flow of funds, etc. The Own vs. Agent vs. API table I cited in the document link I shared earlier shows this.

**Q.20 Which banks or PSPs will we use in the U.S. and offshore?**

That of course is privileged information and the role I play as a commercial deal strategist broker. I have my own pool of solution provider I work with, these are my go-to providers for rolling out a solution.

**Q.21 Are these banking partners reliable and experienced in these flows?**

Yes, of course they are. There is nothing overly complicated and/or sophisticated about this deal flow.

**Q.22 How are customer funds secured? Are accounts segregated?**

Again, this depends on how the deal is structured. Any licensed Money Services Business you deal with, will have a segregated named account for purposes of keeping the funds separate to ensure there is no commingling of funds.

**Q.23 What happens if a transfer is blocked or flagged?**

Three possibilities:

1. Returned.
2. Carried on, i.e. executed and money is delivered to the final destination.
3. Funds Frozen (as explained above).In either of the three scenarios, those involved will try to decipher what is the reason for the blockage or flagging.

**Q.24 How long to launch the system after first payment?**

Depends if you have the technology ready or not. But typically (let’s assume you have a system that is good for such type of transactions), then about 3 to 8 weeks to go live. 3 weeks to go manual launch, and 8 weeks to go with an automated launch, provided you have a technology team behind you.

**Q.25 What is the minimum staff structure to operate?**

- Two people. Minimum: MLRO & Operations/Accounts Manager.Four recommended (MLRO, Operations Manager, Customer Support, Accounts Manager, and Technology Specialist).

**Q.26 How automated is the system (vs. manual tasks)?**

The solution provider you end up working with, may have a fully automated system (White-Label + API), a semi-automated system (APIs only) and or a 100% manual system. Some have all three. It all depends what you are subscribing to. Very rarely would a solution provider give you their complete white-label solution. Much of the world works on the API market model. I think you should start manual, understand the mechanics of the business extremely well and then slowly build your solution.

**Q.27 Who handles KYC/AML and crypto-fiat conversion? What exchanges/OTCs are used?**

The licensed operators do. They use exchanges and/or liquidity partners they are most comfortable with.

**Q.28 How long does each type of transaction take (e.g., USDT, fiat routing)?**

Off-Ramping: 15 minutes to 1 hour (depending on the time of the day and day of the week).

Payments realization into the PLH's nominated account for further payment processing. Usually one day, if not less. No such activity on the weekend, or after banking hours or on gazetted holidays.

Onward payment (say China, Brazil, EU, etc.) This is difficult to say, but usually one day, or as per actuals.

**Q.29 Given we will be needing to sell high amounts of USDT, we would need partners that have high amounts to USDT to sell to dollars every month. How do we get these?**

USDT liquidity is really not an issue. Many of the providers can easily do something like $100MM to $200MM per day!

**Q.30 What is the total monthly cost to run the system (licenses, staff, banks, compliance)?**

You don't run the bank, licenses, compliance. That all is the responsibility of the solution provider you are working with and is included in the monthly cost you are paying them, as well as the volume / commercial charges they are taking from you.

You have to worry about your own costs of staff, cost of marketing, customer support, technology, pre-funding and the money you pay to the solution provider.

**Q.31 What are the fees per transaction? You mentioned around 1% right?**

1. Usually between 75 -to- 80 basis points per transaction
2. Per transaction charge, which might be US$ 1 (minimum) to US$ 2.50 (maximum).
3. There would be a one-time KYB charge which ranges from US$ 25 to US$ 75 (depending on the provider) and
4. KYC charges are usually US$ 2 to US$ 5 per person.The KYC and KYB is done once and is valid for 12 months.

**Q.32 Have you already worked with this structure?**

This is what I do for a living. I take customers such as you, who have an idea for a market opportunity, and I design a solution around it and find them a bona fide licensed provider to work with and structure it as such. This is what the US$ 15,000 is for.

**Q.33 Do you have successful case studies?**

I don't publish my case studies. No client wants to do it, they see it as a leakage of their business model.

Needless to say, you can research me and what I have done/contributed in this field.

**Q.34 Have there been any past legal or regulatory issues?**

In this type of a setup? Sure. I have seen cases where business partners fail to disclose the red flags that should have been very obvious for disclosure.

I have seen clients provide obfuscated information, leading for the transaction to be held, pending further submission for documents.

I have bad source of funds and funds returned and business and channel partners barred from working with a specific financial institution.

There are always problems. You will see all sorts when you work in this field. However, with the relevant controls in place, you can mitigate to a very large degree the bad actors and/or the nefarious transactions from being processed.
