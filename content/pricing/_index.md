## Service Type Descriptions

### Access to Banking (Non-MSB Purposes)
These services are intended for companies that do not fall under the definition of a Money Services Business (MSB). These clients are generally involved in traditional commercial activities such as consulting, e-commerce, B2B services, and other general business functions that do not involve the transmission of funds on behalf of others. These bank accounts are for general corporate use and are not equipped for regulated financial activities like money transfers.

### Access to Banking for MSB Purposes
This category is designed for businesses that qualify as MSBs under applicable regulatory frameworks. These businesses typically engage in activities such as money transmission, currency exchange, or prepaid card services. The banking partners in this category understand the compliance obligations and risks associated with servicing MSBs, and the account onboarding process includes enhanced due diligence.

### Access to Banking for MSB Purposes (International Transfers)
These accounts cater specifically to MSBs that are involved in cross-border or international remittances. The solution supports corridors across both emerging and developed markets and includes support for wire transfers, SWIFT payments, and local payout capabilities where applicable. These setups are often used by money transfer operators, crypto ramp providers, or fintech startups offering borderless payment solutions.

### Access to Banking w/ MTL Coverage
This service includes not only banking access but also coverage under an existing Money Transmitter License (MTL) in the United States. It is ideal for startups and fintechs who want to operate legally in the U.S. without acquiring their own licenses. This service allows participation under a white-label or agent arrangement, enabling lawful money transmission activity through the sponsoring license holder.

### Escrow / Settlement Account (U.S. and International)
These accounts are built for transactional businesses that require third-party settlement or custodial handling of funds—ideal for platforms managing funds on behalf of others (e.g., marketplaces, FX brokers, or remittance companies). U.S. options include KYC/AML compliance support. International options vary by jurisdiction and are tailored to specific regulatory environments and business needs.
