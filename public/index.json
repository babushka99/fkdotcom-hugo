[{"content":" FAQ: What Does It Cost to Launch a U.S. BaaS-Based Banking \u0026amp; Payment Platform as a Foreign Entity? Q1: What is the most cost-effective way for a non-U.S. entrepreneur to access U.S. banking infrastructure? Instead of applying for your own U.S. money transmitter licenses—which can cost between $1.7 million and $2.3 million for nationwide coverage—the more affordable and faster route is to partner with a licensed Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider. This allows you to offer U.S. bank accounts and related services to international clients, such as freelancers in Bangladesh, Nigeria, India, and other countries.\nQ2: What are the typical one-time setup costs when working with a BaaS provider? BaaS solution providers usually charge a one-time onboarding and integration fee that ranges from $10,000 to $50,000. The average is around $15,000 to $20,000. This covers compliance setup, platform integration, and onboarding support.\nQ3: Are there monthly minimums or revenue guarantees involved? Yes. Most providers require a monthly revenue commitment ranging from $3,000 to $25,000 per month, depending on your business model. A safe working average is about $7,500 per month, or $90,000 per year.\nQ4: What ongoing account and transaction fees should I expect? You can expect the following recurring costs:\n$1 to $10 per account per month, depending on risk profile and volume\nTransaction revenue share based on your customer type:\nB2B: around 10 basis points (0.10%) B2C: up to 50 basis points (0.50%) Typical average: approximately 25 basis points (0.25%) Q5: What is your consulting fee for facilitating this setup? The consulting fee for our advisory services, including introductions and structuring, is $15,000 one-time.\nQ6: Is there a minimum capital requirement to qualify for BaaS access? Yes. Most BaaS providers require proof of liquid capital of at least $250,000 held in a company-owned bank account. This ensures you have the financial strength to sustain operations, meet minimum commitments, and grow the business.\nQ7: What is the estimated total budget required to get started?

A $30,000 budget may be enough to begin consultations and early discussions, but it is not enough to fully launch and maintain a functional platform. You would need to secure the rest of the capital or bring in co-investors to scale.\nQ9: What kind of clients or use cases does this setup support? This model is suitable for:\nFreelancers and remote workers receiving international payments Startups offering white-label digital banking services Small and mid-sized businesses with cross-border transactions Fintechs using crypto or stablecoins that need fiat banking access Q10: Can you help with introductions to BaaS providers and structuring the project?
