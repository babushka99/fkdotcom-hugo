Entrepreneurs, exporters, and importers alike are seeking mechanisms to bypass the limitations of the local banking system and access U.S. dollars for trade, payments, and capital preservation. This project responds directly to that need by offering a dual-structure payments and compliance framework that enables cross-border settlements via both traditional fiat and crypto rails (specifically USDT).\nBy combining regulated U.S.-based entities with offshore operational flexibility‚Äîbacked by expert guidance and access to licensed providers‚Äîthis solution creates an end-to-end model that is adaptable, fast to implement, and aligned with international financial compliance requirements. Whether the goal is to facilitate named account payments to U.S. vendors, or route payments to non-U.S. destinations such as China, Europe, or Latin America, this platform is built to scale with transparency, legality, and operational efficiency at its core.\nSolution Architecture: This cross-border payment solution is structured around a dual-entity framework that enables legally compliant, operationally flexible payments from Bolivia to both U.S. and non-U.S. destinations, using either fiat or stablecoin rails. The structure is designed for B2B and high-value cross-border type payments.\nFlow of Funds Dual-Entity Model U.S. Entity (Regulated Pathway for U.S.-Bound Transactions) Legal Basis: Operates under a Money Services Business (MSB) registration and is covered by a licensed Money Transmitter (MTL) through an agent sponsorship model. Functionality: Receive USD via wire, USDT liquidation, or conversion Settle named or unnamed payments to vendors across the United States Maintain compliance logs and regulatory filings (e.g., SARs, CTRs) via sponsor Banking: U.S. banking is provided via BaaS platform or sponsor\u0026rsquo;s bank account Dedicated sub-accounts for clients may be possible depending on sponsor Non-U.S. Entity (Flexible International Settlement Path) Location: Jurisdictions include Canada (preferred), Malta, Turkey, Panama, or UAE Functionality: Facilitate transactions that do not touch the U.S. financial system Receive funds via crypto or wire Pay out to counterparties in China, Europe, LATAM, etc. Avoid U.S.-specific regulatory requirements (e.g., FinCEN, OFAC) Banking: Uses international multi-currency bank accounts or PSPs (Payment Service Providers) USDT/USDC-compatible wallets may be custodial or self-hosted depending on risk appetite Fund Flow Variants USD-Offshore Flow (Indirect Fiat Path) Importer in Bolivia pays a local exporter in BOB. Exporter transfers equivalent USD from offshore account (e.g., in Switzerland). Funds enter U.S. sponsor bank account or PSP wallet. Sponsor entity disburses funds to U.S. beneficiary (e.g., vendor, service provider). Use Case: Ideal for transactions where importer wants to pay a U.S. entity without going through Bolivia‚Äôs central bank.\nStablecoin Flow (USDT Path) Importer purchases USDT locally via Binance P2P or OTC desk or local preferred crypto exchange. USDT is sent to solution provider‚Äôs wallet (U.S. or offshore). USDT is liquidated into fiat (via exchange or OTC). Fiat is delivered to the end vendor or credited to an IBAN or bank account. Use Case: High speed, less dependency on correspondent banks, ideal for countries with currency controls.\nNon-U.S. Routing Path (Cross-Border B2B) BOB is converted into crypto or routed through informal channels. Non-U.S. entity receives USD/USDT and disburses payment to Europe, China, or LATAM. Payment is made from Canadian, Maltese, or Turkish PSP account depending on geography. Use Case: Used for payments from Bolivia to Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, etc. where U.S. regulation is unnecessary or undesirable.\nCompliance Layer U.S. Entity: Covered under MTL licensing of sponsor AML policies enforced by the sponsor Monthly, quarterly reporting (dependent on state and FinCEN) KYC/KYB managed via integrated onboarding partner (e.g., Alloy, SumSub) Non-U.S. Entity: Follows local AML/KYC regulations (e.g., FINTRAC in Canada) May use custodial or decentralized wallets depending on local law Provides auditability, but no U.S. data-sharing requirement unless involved with U.S. banking Technical Infrastructure Options Custody: Hosted wallet providers, cold storage, or hybrid models (e.g., Fireblocks) KYC Integration: Document upload + sanctions screening Transaction Monitoring: Real-time rules engine for velocity, fraud, and sanctions triggers Accounting: Sub-account ledgering for reconciliation of inbound/outbound flows Scalability Notes Suitable for MVP starting at $500K/month Scales cleanly to $10M+/month with better pricing, vendor trust, and liquidity access Modular expansion: additional corridors can be layered with provider consent Client Advisory Fee (Faisal Khan LLC) To assemble either the U.S. program, the non-U.S. program, or both, our consulting fee is US$ 15,000, covering:\nFlow structuring and entity mapping Partner sourcing (MTL sponsors, processors, compliance teams) Documentation and onboarding materials Strategic advisory for 60 days post-launch Payment Terms:\n50% upfront to begin work 50% upon signing with the selected solution provider You will also receive:\nA licensing comparison matrix (own license vs. agent/API sponsorship) Estimated costs and processing timelines Best-practice playbooks on compliance and fund flows Probability of Success:\nEstimated at 95% based on experience and vetted partner access.\nMoney-Back Guarantee:\nIf no solution provider is secured within 120 days, your entire advance will be refunded, no deductions.\nSolution Provider Pricing (Estimated Commercials) The following are estimates only. Final pricing and obligations are outlined in the solution provider‚Äôs commercial term sheet.\nTransaction Fees: 0.15% to 1.0% depending on provider; typical: 0.5%‚Äì0.75% Sponsorship/Agent Setup Fees: $5,000 to $25,000 (most common: $10,000‚Äì$15,000) Monthly Operations Fees: $3,000 to $5,000/month Ancillary Costs (Named Accounts, Compliance Officer, additional corridors): May apply depending on your use case Coverage includes: Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Chile, and more. Expanding to a new country may trigger added compliance review costs.\nContext: Obtaining a U.S. MTL in all 50 states can cost $2.2 million and take up to 2 years. This solution gives you nearly instant access via sponsorship‚Äîlegally, scalable, and at a fraction of the cost. (Click Here to See US Money Transmitter License Application Filing Pricing). Learn more about the different License Options (advantages \u0026amp; disadvantages) between Applying for your own Money Transmitter License vs. Being an Agent (Authorized Delegate) vs. API Relationship. [Click here to see table]\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Q1: Is this legal?\nYes, provided the U.S. arm operates under an MSB registration and licensed MTL sponsor. The offshore arm adheres to the legal frameworks of its respective jurisdiction.\nQ2: What are the biggest risks?\nOperating without licensing in the U.S. can lead to jail time, asset seizure, or de-banking. Working under licensed structures eliminates this risk.\nQ3: Do we need a team in the U.S.?\nNo. Operations can be conducted remotely, provided proper compliance protocols and sponsorship relationships are in place.\nQ4: Can this model support payments to countries outside the U.S.?\nYes, using the non-U.S. entity. Ideal for routes into China, Europe, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela (for OFAC-exempt food trade), and all other LATAM markets including Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Chile.\nQ5: Where does the USD come from?\nFrom gold and silver exporters, remitters, and diaspora. Optionally, USDT can be purchased in-country and converted onshore.\nQ6: What kind of clients benefit most?\nImporters who need access to USD, exporters who receive offshore USD, and individuals looking to safeguard their savings or conduct cross-border trade.\nQ7: Is stablecoin use mandatory?\nNo, but it is increasingly common in Bolivia. Stablecoins allow for faster, traceable settlements with reduced counterparty risk.\nQ8: What\u0026rsquo;s the minimum viable volume?\nRoughly $2 million per month. Below that, the operating cost of compliance and sponsorship may outweigh the returns.\nQ9: Can you assist with setting up companies or bank accounts?\nYes. We offer turnkey assistance with LLC/IBC formations, account opening, compliance onboarding, and flow structuring.\nQ10: What if the end vendor requires named payments?\nWe support named accounts, allowing the U.S. payment to reflect the actual importer‚Äôs entity name‚Äîimportant for customs, invoices, and AML compliance.\nQ11: What does it take to access Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) infrastructure?\nSignificant capital strength and customer base are required. Typically, providers expect:\nA community of at least 1,000 active accounts\nMinimum cumulative deposits of $2 million\nWithout this scale, BaaS providers may decline onboarding or offer only limited functionality.\nQ12: Can this evolve into a long-term financial platform post-crisis?\nAbsolutely. There‚Äôs strong market demand for multi-currency wallets, digital debit cards, and the ability to store, send, and receive funds globally‚Äîbypassing fragile local banking systems. With the right setup, this operation can become a trusted alternative to traditional banking.\nQ13: Is there a way to start small and scale gradually?\nThis is a common challenge. While Minimum Viable Product (MVP) models exist, the market sets baseline infrastructure expectations. For example, processing just $200K‚Äì$300K/month‚Äîeven at a 2% spread‚Äîonly yields $6K/month in gross revenue, which limits your operational capacity. The real advantages begin to emerge at $2M+/month in volume, where you gain access to better pricing, credibility, and system efficiencies.\nQ14: Will I need to get a surety bond?\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re acting as an agent under someone else\u0026rsquo;s license, you will not need to post your own surety bond. However, if the sponsor requires an increase in bond coverage due to your transaction volume, you may be asked to cover the incremental premium.\nQ.15 What is the total initial investment required (licenses, structure, consulting, banks, tech, etc.)?\nThe pricing varies from solution provider to solution provider. Here are some approximate numbers for you: My consultancy fees (which is fixed), is US$ 15,000 of which, 50% is up-front and 50% is upon signing with the solution provider. The commercials for solution provider, you can see from Solution Provider Pricing (estimated commercials): https://faisalkhanllc.notion.site/Bolivia-USD-USDT-Project-239f149ceaef808eb60bfaf19452f1a6 (this has already been shared with you). From a company standpoint, you need to be liquid for US$ 125,000 (on average) to qualify for a sponsorship. Some licensed solution providers might even work with you, if your liquidity stands at US$ 75,000.Most solution providers will work on a funds good-and-settled model, so if any refunding is required, you are required to put up that prefunding. Q.16 I know you mentioned you are already working with a client from Bolivia. Has a compliance/legal review been done for Bolivia and the involved countries (AML, KYC, FX controls)?\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what you mean by a compliance/legal review. Review what? The licensed money services business, that holds the necessary money transmitters licenses, did their Enhanced Due Diligence with the Bolivian Partner that they are working with, (as required by law) and are in the midst of setting up their system so that their clients, (i.e. the clients of the Bolivian Partner), can be onboarded to have their accounts (this was a requirement from this particular Partner). Each business they are onboarding is being given a specialized clearing account in US Dollars as the end beneficiaries are asking that payments from these Bolivian customers come from a named account.\nFrom an AML, KYB, and FX Controls points of view, let me comment as much as I can briefly on this subject.\nThe AML controls that are in place, have nothing alarming, or rather no red-flag has gone off, with regards to this particular Partner and the customers that they are onboarding. From a KYB (Know Your Business) point of view, the documentation being provided, suffice the minimum standards that the Principal License Holder has, are being met. From an FX Control point of view. They are not concerned about that, as they are receiving USDT into their account, or US Dollars from outside of Bolivia, into their account to do either net-to-net or book-to-book settlement with their counterparts in Bolivia \u0026amp;/or settle, make payments as per the given instructions by the client. There is no case where US Dollars are being sent out of Bolivia, or that Bolivianos (BOB) are being shipped out of Bolivia. The PLH (Principal License Holder) is only working with countries they feel comfortable to work with, i.e. US, Canada, UK, EU (various), Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, China/HK, UAE to name a few. Q.17 What legal exposure do we face at each stage of the transaction flow?\nThat is something for your lawyer to tell you. Not me, as you would be bound by a contract. If you are an Authorized Delegate, then you\u0026rsquo;re in the Flow of Funds and are hence responsible for the transaction and its good execution.\nIf you are an API functionary, then you are not in the Flow of Funds, then the legal exposure is low, but never zero. The counterparty risk is high, as you do not control the flow of the transaction nor are in possession of the funds.\nTo work out the legal exposure at each stage of the transaction, you need to have a defined (signed off Flow of Funds), something like I have shared, and then an understanding of the model under which you are functioning.\nQ.18 How do we avoid regulatory risk (e.g., fund freezes, audits)?\nAn Audit is not a regulatory risk, but rather part and parcel of doing business in a regulated world, so it should not be looked upon as something to avoid. Just wanted to clarify that. Funds freeze will happen because of one of three things (I\u0026rsquo;m being overly limited here, albeit the reasons can be many).\nFreezing of fund, because the funds are originating from a wallet or associated with a business or are going to a wallet or a business that is deemed flagged for some reason. We will never know the reason why it was flagged, just suffice to say, you would be informed that the funds have been frozen. This is rare. Funds are temporarily frozen, pending additional paperwork that is requested, once the paperwork has been provided and to the satisfaction of the institution that instituted the freeze, the funds are released. This can be anywhere from one week to as long as six months. There is no average. But if such a transaction freeze does happen, it is usually between 4 to 6 weeks. Clients sign up for this, i.e. they are knowledgeable and it is highlighted in the contract agreement that they sign. A court order. If for some reason a court order initiates a freeze or a government body, then the funds would be frozen and you may/may-not know about the reason behind the freeze. In most cases once the government freezes funds, they are hardly ever released, and if released it is a super involved process. Q.19 Is it legal for us to operate as financial intermediaries in this structure?\nOnly if you are licensed as a financial intermediary or an agent/authorized delegate of one. You can also do the business without being a financial intermediary, but then you would not be in the flow of funds, etc. The Own vs. Agent vs. API table I cited in the document link I shared earlier shows this.\nQ.20 Which banks or PSPs will we use in the U.S. and offshore?\nThat of course is privileged information and the role I play as a commercial deal strategist broker. I have my own pool of solution provider I work with, these are my go-to providers for rolling out a solution.\nQ.21 Are these banking partners reliable and experienced in these flows?\nYes, of course they are. There is nothing overly complicated and/or sophisticated about this deal flow.\nQ.22 How are customer funds secured? Are accounts segregated?\nAgain, this depends on how the deal is structured. Any licensed Money Services Business you deal with, will have a segregated named account for purposes of keeping the funds separate to ensure there is no commingling of funds.\nQ.23 What happens if a transfer is blocked or flagged?\nThree possibilities:\nReturned. Carried on, i.e. executed and money is delivered to the final destination. Funds Frozen (as explained above).In either of the three scenarios, those involved will try to decipher what is the reason for the blockage or flagging. Q.24 How long to launch the system after first payment?\nDepends if you have the technology ready or not. But typically (let‚Äôs assume you have a system that is good for such type of transactions), then about 3 to 8 weeks to go live. 3 weeks to go manual launch, and 8 weeks to go with an automated launch, provided you have a technology team behind you.\nQ.25 What is the minimum staff structure to operate?\nTwo people. Minimum: MLRO \u0026amp; Operations/Accounts Manager.Four recommended (MLRO, Operations Manager, Customer Support, Accounts Manager, and Technology Specialist). Q.26 How automated is the system (vs. manual tasks)?\nThe solution provider you end up working with, may have a fully automated system (White-Label + API), a semi-automated system (APIs only) and or a 100% manual system. Some have all three. It all depends what you are subscribing to. Very rarely would a solution provider give you their complete white-label solution. Much of the world works on the API market model. I think you should start manual, understand the mechanics of the business extremely well and then slowly build your solution.\nQ.27 Who handles KYC/AML and crypto-fiat conversion? What exchanges/OTCs are used?\nThe licensed operators do. They use exchanges and/or liquidity partners they are most comfortable with.\nQ.28 How long does each type of transaction take (e.g., USDT, fiat routing)?\nOff-Ramping: 15 minutes to 1 hour (depending on the time of the day and day of the week).\nPayments realization into the PLH\u0026rsquo;s nominated account for further payment processing. Usually one day, if not less. No such activity on the weekend, or after banking hours or on gazetted holidays.\nOnward payment (say China, Brazil, EU, etc.) This is difficult to say, but usually one day, or as per actuals.\nQ.29 Given we will be needing to sell high amounts of USDT, we would need partners that have high amounts to USDT to sell to dollars every month. How do we get these?\nUSDT liquidity is really not an issue. Many of the providers can easily do something like $100MM to $200MM per day!\nQ.30 What is the total monthly cost to run the system (licenses, staff, banks, compliance)?\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t run the bank, licenses, compliance. That all is the responsibility of the solution provider you are working with and is included in the monthly cost you are paying them, as well as the volume / commercial charges they are taking from you.\nYou have to worry about your own costs of staff, cost of marketing, customer support, technology, pre-funding and the money you pay to the solution provider.\nQ.31 What are the fees per transaction? You mentioned around 1% right?\nUsually between 75 -to- 80 basis points per transaction Per transaction charge, which might be US$ 1 (minimum) to US$ 2.50 (maximum). There would be a one-time KYB charge which ranges from US$ 25 to US$ 75 (depending on the provider) and KYC charges are usually US$ 2 to US$ 5 per person.The KYC and KYB is done once and is valid for 12 months. Q.32 Have you already worked with this structure?\nThis is what I do for a living. I take customers such as you, who have an idea for a market opportunity, and I design a solution around it and find them a bona fide licensed provider to work with and structure it as such. This is what the US$ 15,000 is for.\nQ.33 Do you have successful case studies?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t publish my case studies. No client wants to do it, they see it as a leakage of their business model.\nNeedless to say, you can research me and what I have done/contributed in this field.\nQ.34 Have there been any past legal or regulatory issues?\nIn this type of a setup? Sure. I have seen cases where business partners fail to disclose the red flags that should have been very obvious for disclosure.\nI have seen clients provide obfuscated information, leading for the transaction to be held, pending further submission for documents.\nI have bad source of funds and funds returned and business and channel partners barred from working with a specific financial institution.\nThere are always problems. You will see all sorts when you work in this field. However, with the relevant controls in place, you can mitigate to a very large degree the bad actors and/or the nefarious transactions from being processed.\nSpanish Version Resumen Ejecutivo En respuesta a la grave escasez de d√≥lares en Bolivia, los estrictos controles de capital y la dependencia de canales informales, proponemos una soluci√≥n de pagos transfronterizos que combina dos estructuras legales y operativas: una entidad regulada en EE.‚ÄØUU. y una entidad offshore flexible. Este modelo permite liquidaciones tanto en moneda fiduciaria (USD) como en stablecoin (USDT), garantizando rapidez, transparencia y cumplimiento con las normativas internacionales.\nLa Entidad en EE.‚ÄØUU. opera bajo registro MSB y licencia de Money Transmitter (MTL) mediante un patrocinador, lo que facilita la recepci√≥n de USD y la liquidaci√≥n de pagos nominados a proveedores estadounidenses, manteniendo registros regulatorios y reportes de AML/KYC. La Entidad no Estadounidense, ubicada en jurisdicciones como Canad√°, Malta, Turqu√≠a, Panam√° o EAU, gestiona flujos que evitan el sistema financiero de EE.‚ÄØUU., recibiendo fondos por cripto o transferencia bancaria y desembols√°ndolos en mercados de LATAM, Europa o Asia sin los requisitos FinCEN/OFAC.\nExisten tres variantes de flujo de fondos:\nUSD‚ÄëOffshore (Fiduciario indirecto): el exportador transfiere USD desde una cuenta offshore a la cuenta del patrocinador en EE.‚ÄØUU., que luego paga al beneficiario local. Stablecoin (USDT): el importador compra USDT localmente, lo env√≠a a la cartera del proveedor, lo liquida a fiat y efect√∫a el pago final. Ruta no estadounidense: la entidad offshore recibe USD/USDT y desembolsa pagos directos a Europa, China o LATAM desde su PSP local. Nuestra consultor√≠a, con una tarifa √∫nica de US$‚ÄØ15‚ÄØ000, cubre desde la estructuraci√≥n de flujos y mapeo de entidades, hasta la selecci√≥n de patrocinadores y la elaboraci√≥n de todos los materiales de cumplimiento, con asesor√≠a estrat√©gica 60 d√≠as post‚Äëlanzamiento. El pago se divide en 50‚ÄØ% al inicio y 50‚ÄØ% al firmar con el proveedor, y ofrecemos una garant√≠a de reembolso total si no se asegura un patrocinador en 120‚ÄØd√≠as.\nEste enfoque permite lanzar un MVP desde US$‚ÄØ500‚ÄØ000/mes y escalar a m√°s de US$‚ÄØ10‚ÄØM/mes, con costos y tiempos de implementaci√≥n significativamente inferiores a los de una licencia MTL propia (US$‚ÄØ2,2‚ÄØM y hasta 2‚ÄØa√±os). Con una probabilidad de √©xito estimada en 95‚ÄØ%, esta soluci√≥n brinda acceso inmediato a canales formales de USD y stablecoins, mitigando riesgos de desbancarizaci√≥n y sanciones.\nResumen del Proyecto: Habilitaci√≥n de Pagos Transfronterizos Bolivia-USD/USDT Visi√≥n General Ante la grave escasez de d√≥lares en Bolivia, los estrictos controles de capital y la creciente dependencia de canales financieros informales, existe una necesidad urgente de v√≠as leg√≠timas, eficientes y conformes para mover dinero a trav√©s de fronteras. Emprendedores, exportadores e importadores buscan mecanismos para eludir las limitaciones del sistema bancario local y acceder a d√≥lares estadounidenses para comercio, pagos y preservaci√≥n de capital. Este proyecto responde directamente a esa necesidad ofreciendo un marco de pagos y cumplimiento de doble estructura que habilita liquidaciones transfronterizas tanto por canales tradicionales de moneda fiduciaria como por ra√≠les de criptomoneda (espec√≠ficamente USDT).\nAl combinar entidades reguladas con sede en EE.‚ÄØUU. con flexibilidad operativa offshore‚ÄØ‚Äîrespaldado por asesor√≠a experta y acceso a proveedores con licencia‚Äîesta soluci√≥n crea un modelo integral adaptable, de r√°pida implementaci√≥n y alineado con los requisitos de cumplimiento financiero internacional. Ya sea para facilitar pagos con cuenta nominada a proveedores en EE.‚ÄØUU. o para enrutar pagos a destinos fuera de EE.‚ÄØUU. como China, Europa o Latinoam√©rica, esta plataforma est√° dise√±ada para escalar con transparencia, legalidad y eficiencia operativa en su n√∫cleo.\nArquitectura de la Soluci√≥n Esta soluci√≥n de pagos transfronterizos se estructura en torno a un modelo de doble entidad que permite pagos conformes y operativamente flexibles desde Bolivia hacia destinos en EE.‚ÄØUU. y fuera de EE.‚ÄØUU., utilizando ra√≠les de moneda fiduciaria o stablecoin. La estructura est√° pensada para pagos B2B de alto valor.\nFlujo de Fondos Modelo de Doble Entidad Entidad en EE.‚ÄØUU. (V√≠a Regulada para Transacciones con Destino en EE.‚ÄØUU.) Base Legal: Opera bajo el registro como Money Services Business (MSB) y est√° amparada por una licencia de Money Transmitter (MTL) mediante un modelo de patrocinio de agente. Funcionalidad: Recepci√≥n de USD v√≠a transferencia bancaria, liquidaci√≥n de USDT o conversi√≥n. Liquidaci√≥n de pagos nominados o no nominados a proveedores en todo EE.‚ÄØUU. Mantenimiento de registros de cumplimiento y presentaciones regulatorias (p.‚ÄØej., SARs, CTRs) a trav√©s del patrocinador. Banca: Servicio bancario en EE.‚ÄØUU. provisto por plataforma BaaS o cuenta bancaria del patrocinador. Posibilidad de subcuentas dedicadas para clientes, seg√∫n los t√©rminos del patrocinador. Ubicaci√≥n: Jurisdicciones sugeridas: Canad√° (preferido), Malta, Turqu√≠a, Panam√° o EAU. Entidad no Estadounidense (V√≠a Internacional Flexible) Funcionalidad: Facilitar transacciones que no impliquen al sistema financiero de EE.‚ÄØUU. Recepci√≥n de fondos v√≠a criptomoneda o transferencia bancaria. Pago a contrapartes en China, Europa, LATAM, etc. Evasi√≥n de requisitos regulatorios espec√≠ficos de EE.‚ÄØUU. (p.‚ÄØej., FinCEN, OFAC). Banca: Uso de cuentas bancarias internacionales multicurrency o PSPs (Payment Service Providers). Carteras compatibles con USDT/USDC, custodiadas o auto-hospedadas seg√∫n apetito de riesgo. Variantes de Flujo de Fondos Flujo USD-Offshore (V√≠a Fiduciaria Indirecta) El importador en Bolivia paga al exportador local en BOB. El exportador transfiere el equivalente en USD desde una cuenta offshore (p.‚ÄØej., Suiza). Los fondos ingresan a la cuenta bancaria del patrocinador en EE.‚ÄØUU. o a su billetera PSP. La entidad patrocinadora distribuye fondos al beneficiario en EE.‚ÄØUU. (p.‚ÄØej., proveedor, prestador de servicios). Caso de uso: Ideal cuando el importador quiere pagar a una entidad estadounidense sin pasar por el banco central de Bolivia.\nFlujo de Stablecoin (V√≠a USDT) El importador adquiere USDT localmente (Binance P2P, mesa OTC u otro exchange local). El USDT se env√≠a a la cartera del proveedor de la soluci√≥n (EE.‚ÄØUU. u offshore). El USDT se liquida en moneda fiduciaria (v√≠a exchange u OTC). La moneda fiduciaria se entrega al proveedor final o se acredita en una cuenta IBAN o bancaria. Caso de uso: Alta velocidad, menor dependencia de bancos corresponsales; ideal para pa√≠ses con controles de cambio.\nRuta de Enrutamiento No Estadounidense (B2B Transfronterizo) Se convierte BOB en cripto o se enruta por canales informales. La entidad no estadounidense recibe USD/USDT y desembolsa el pago a Europa, China o LATAM. El pago se realiza desde la cuenta PSP en Canad√°, Malta o Turqu√≠a seg√∫n la geograf√≠a. Caso de uso: Pagos de Bolivia a Brasil, Argentina, Colombia, Per√∫, Chile, etc., donde la regulaci√≥n de EE.‚ÄØUU. no es necesaria o es indeseable.\nCapa de Cumplimiento Entidad en EE.‚ÄØUU.: Amparada por la licencia MTL del patrocinador. Pol√≠ticas AML aplicadas por el patrocinador. Reportes mensuales y trimestrales (seg√∫n estado y FinCEN). KYC/KYB gestionados mediante socio de onboarding integrado (p.‚ÄØej., Alloy, SumSub). Entidad no Estadounidense: Cumple con regulaciones locales AML/KYC (p.‚ÄØej., FINTRAC en Canad√°). Uso de carteras custodiadas o descentralizadas seg√∫n la ley local. Proporciona auditabilidad sin requisitos de intercambio de datos con EE.‚ÄØUU., salvo que involucre banca estadounidense. Opciones de Infraestructura T√©cnica Custodia: Proveedores de billeteras hospedadas, almacenamiento en fr√≠o o modelos h√≠bridos (p.‚ÄØej., Fireblocks). Integraci√≥n KYC: Carga de documentos y cribado de sanciones. Monitoreo de Transacciones: Motor de reglas en tiempo real para velocidad, fraude y sanciones. Contabilidad: Ledger de subcuentas para conciliaci√≥n de flujos entrantes y salientes. Notas de Escalabilidad Adecuado para un MVP con inicio en US$‚ÄØ500‚ÄØ000/mes. Escala hasta US$‚ÄØ10‚ÄØM+/mes con mejores tarifas, confianza de proveedores y acceso a liquidez. Expansi√≥n modular: corredores adicionales pueden a√±adirse con consentimiento del proveedor. Honorarios de Asesor√≠a al Cliente (Faisal‚ÄØKhan LLC) Para ensamblar el programa en EE.‚ÄØUU., el programa no estadounidense o ambos, nuestra tarifa de consultor√≠a es US$‚ÄØ15‚ÄØ000, que incluye:\nEstructuraci√≥n de flujos y mapeo de entidades. B√∫squeda de socios (patrocinadores MTL, procesadores, equipos de cumplimiento). Documentaci√≥n y materiales de incorporaci√≥n. Asesor√≠a estrat√©gica durante 60 d√≠as post-lanzamiento. T√©rminos de Pago:\n50‚ÄØ% por adelantado para iniciar el trabajo. 50‚ÄØ% al firmar con el proveedor seleccionado. Adem√°s recibir√°:\nMatriz comparativa de licencias (propia vs. agente/API). Costos estimados y plazos de procesamiento. Manuales de mejores pr√°cticas en cumplimiento y flujos de fondos. Probabilidad de √âxito:\nEstimada en 95‚ÄØ% seg√∫n experiencia y acceso a socios verificados.\nGarant√≠a de Reembolso:\nSi no se asegura un proveedor en 120‚ÄØd√≠as, se reembolsar√° el 100‚ÄØ% del anticipo, sin deducciones.\nPrecios Estimados del Proveedor de la Soluci√≥n Los siguientes son solo estimaciones. Los precios finales y obligaciones se detallan en la hoja de t√©rminos comerciales del proveedor.\nComisiones por Transacci√≥n: 0,15‚ÄØ% a 1‚ÄØ% seg√∫n proveedor; t√≠pico: 0,5‚ÄØ%‚Äì0,75‚ÄØ%. Cuotas de Configuraci√≥n de Patrocinio/Agente: US$‚ÄØ5‚ÄØ000 a US$‚ÄØ25‚ÄØ000 (m√°s com√∫n: US$‚ÄØ10‚ÄØ000‚ÄìUS$‚ÄØ15‚ÄØ000). Cuotas Operativas Mensuales: US$‚ÄØ3‚ÄØ000 a US$‚ÄØ5‚ÄØ000/mes. Costos Auxiliares (Cuentas Nominadas, Oficial de Cumplimiento, corredores adicionales): Pueden aplicar seg√∫n caso de uso. Cobertura incluye: Argentina, Brasil, Ecuador, Colombia, Per√∫, Chile y m√°s. Expandirse a un nuevo pa√≠s puede implicar costos adicionales de revisi√≥n de cumplimiento.\nContexto: Obtener una MTL en EE.‚ÄØUU. para 50 estados puede costar US$‚ÄØ2,2‚ÄØmillones y llevar hasta 2‚ÄØa√±os. Esta soluci√≥n ofrece acceso casi instant√°neo v√≠a patrocinio‚Äîlegal, escalable y a una fracci√≥n del costo.

El brazo offshore cumple con marcos legales de su jurisdicci√≥n.\nP2: ¬øCu√°les son los mayores riesgos?\nOperar sin licencia en EE.‚ÄØUU. puede conllevar prisi√≥n, embargo de activos o cierre de cuentas. Trabajar bajo estructuras autorizadas elimina ese riesgo.\nP3: ¬øNecesitamos un equipo en EE.‚ÄØUU.?\nNo. Las operaciones pueden realizarse de forma remota con protocolos de cumplimiento y relaciones de patrocinio establecidos.\nP4: ¬øEste modelo soporta pagos a pa√≠ses fuera de EE.‚ÄØUU.?\nS√≠, mediante la entidad no estadounidense. Ideal para rutas hacia China, Europa, Brasil, Argentina, Venezuela (para comercio de alimentos exento de OFAC) y todos los mercados LATAM incluyendo Ecuador, Colombia, Per√∫ y Chile.\nP5: ¬øDe d√≥nde provienen los USD?\nDe exportadores de oro y plata, remitentes y di√°spora. Opcionalmente, se puede adquirir USDT localmente y convertir onshore.\nP6: ¬øQu√© tipo de clientes se benefician m√°s?\nImportadores que necesitan acceso a USD, exportadores que reciben USD offshore e individuos que buscan proteger sus ahorros o realizar comercio transfronterizo.\nP7: ¬øEs obligatorio usar stablecoin?\nNo, pero es cada vez m√°s com√∫n en Bolivia. Las stablecoins permiten liquidaciones m√°s r√°pidas, trazables y con menor riesgo de contraparte.\nP8: ¬øCu√°l es el volumen m√≠nimo viable?\nAproximadamente US$‚ÄØ2‚ÄØmillones/mes. Por debajo, el costo de cumplimiento y patrocinio puede superar los retornos.\nP9: ¬øPueden ayudar con la creaci√≥n de empresas o cuentas bancarias?\nS√≠. Ofrecemos asistencia turnkey para formaci√≥n de LLC/IBC, apertura de cuentas, incorporaci√≥n de cumplimiento y estructuraci√≥n de flujos.\nP10: ¬øQu√© pasa si el proveedor final requiere pagos nominados?\nSoportamos cuentas nominadas, permitiendo que el pago en EE.‚ÄØUU. refleje el nombre real de la entidad importadora‚Äîcrucial para aduanas, facturas y cumplimiento AML.\nP11: ¬øQu√© se necesita para acceder a infraestructura BaaS?\nSe requiere:\nUna comunidad de al menos 1‚ÄØ000 cuentas activas.\nDep√≥sitos acumulados m√≠nimos de US$‚ÄØ2‚ÄØmillones.\nSin esta escala, los proveedores BaaS pueden rechazar la incorporaci√≥n o ofrecer funcionalidad limitada.\nP12: ¬øPuede evolucionar a una plataforma financiera a largo plazo post-crisis?\nAbsolutamente. Existe alta demanda de billeteras multicurrency, tarjetas digitales de d√©bito y la capacidad de enviar, recibir y almacenar fondos globalmente‚Äîeludiendo sistemas bancarios locales fr√°giles.\nP13: ¬øHay forma de empezar peque√±o y escalar gradualmente?\nS√≠, aunque los MVPs existen, el mercado impone expectativas de infraestructura. Por ejemplo, procesar US$‚ÄØ200‚ÄØ000‚Äì300‚ÄØ000/mes‚Äîcon un margen del 2‚ÄØ%‚Äîgenera solo US$‚ÄØ6‚ÄØ000/mes en ingresos brutos, lo que limita la capacidad operativa. Las ventajas reales surgen a partir de US$‚ÄØ2‚ÄØM+/mes, con mejores precios, credibilidad y eficiencia.\nP14: ¬øNecesitar√© una fianza de garant√≠a?\nSi act√∫a como agente bajo licencia ajena, no necesitar√° depositar su propia fianza. Sin embargo, si el patrocinador exige mayor cobertura de fianza por volumen de transacciones, podr√≠a solicit√°rsele cubrir la prima incremental.\nP.15 ¬øCu√°l es la inversi√≥n inicial total requerida (licencias, estructura, consultor√≠a, bancos, tecnolog√≠a, etc.)?\n‚Ä¢ Los precios var√≠an de un proveedor de soluciones a otro. A continuaci√≥n, algunos n√∫meros aproximados para usted:\n‚Ä¢ Mis honorarios de consultor√≠a (que son fijos) son de US$ 15,000, de los cuales el 50% se paga por adelantado y el 50% al momento de la firma con el proveedor de soluciones.\n‚Ä¢ Los costos comerciales del proveedor de soluciones se pueden consultar en ‚ÄúSolution Provider Pricing (estimated commercials)‚Äù: https://faisalkhanllc.notion.site/Bolivia-USD-USDT-Project-239f149ceaef808eb60bfaf19452f1a6 (esto ya le ha sido compartido).\n‚Ä¢ Desde el punto de vista de la empresa, necesita contar con una liquidez de US$ 125,000 (en promedio) para calificar para un patrocinio.\n‚Ä¢ Algunos proveedores de soluciones con licencia podr√≠an incluso trabajar con usted si su liquidez es de al menos US$ 75,000.\n‚Ä¢ La mayor√≠a de los proveedores de soluciones trabajar√°n bajo un modelo de fondos buenos y liquidados, por lo tanto, si se requiere alg√∫n reembolso, se le exigir√° que proporcione ese prefinanciamiento.\nP.16 S√© que mencion√≥ que ya est√° trabajando con un cliente de Bolivia. ¬øSe ha realizado una revisi√≥n de cumplimiento/legal para Bolivia y los pa√≠ses involucrados (AML, KYC, controles de cambio)?\nNo estoy seguro de a qu√© se refiere con una revisi√≥n de cumplimiento/legal. ¬øRevisi√≥n de qu√©? El negocio de servicios monetarios con licencia, que posee las licencias necesarias de transmisor de dinero, realiz√≥ su Diligencia Debida Reforzada con el Socio Boliviano con el que est√°n trabajando (seg√∫n lo exige la ley), y est√°n en proceso de configurar su sistema para que sus clientes (es decir, los clientes del Socio Boliviano) puedan ser incorporados y tener sus cuentas (esto fue un requisito de ese Socio en particular). A cada empresa que est√°n incorporando se le est√° asignando una cuenta de compensaci√≥n especializada en d√≥lares estadounidenses, ya que los beneficiarios finales solicitan que los pagos de estos clientes bolivianos provengan de una cuenta nominativa.\nDesde el punto de vista de AML, KYB y controles de cambio, perm√≠tame comentar brevemente sobre este asunto.\n‚Ä¢ Los controles de AML que est√°n implementados no presentan ninguna alarma, o mejor dicho, no se ha activado ninguna se√±al de alerta, con respecto a este Socio en particular y los clientes que est√°n incorporando.\n‚Ä¢ Desde el punto de vista de KYB (Conozca Su Negocio), la documentaci√≥n que se est√° proporcionando cumple con los est√°ndares m√≠nimos requeridos por el Titular de la Licencia Principal.\n‚Ä¢ Desde el punto de vista del control de cambio, no est√°n preocupados, ya que est√°n recibiendo USDT en su cuenta, o d√≥lares estadounidenses desde fuera de Bolivia, en su cuenta para realizar liquidaciones netas o de libro a libro con sus contrapartes en Bolivia y/o para liquidar y efectuar pagos seg√∫n las instrucciones del cliente.\n‚Ä¢ No existe ning√∫n caso en el que se est√©n enviando d√≥lares estadounidenses desde Bolivia, ni tampoco que se est√©n exportando bolivianos (BOB) fuera de Bolivia.\n‚Ä¢ El PLH (Titular Principal de la Licencia) solo trabaja con pa√≠ses con los que se siente c√≥modo, es decir, EE.‚ÄØUU., Canad√°, Reino Unido, Uni√≥n Europea (varios), Brasil, M√©xico, Argentina, China/HK, Emiratos √Årabes Unidos, por nombrar algunos.\nP.17 ¬øQu√© exposici√≥n legal enfrentamos en cada etapa del flujo de transacci√≥n?\nEso es algo que su abogado debe indicarle. No yo, ya que usted estar√≠a obligado por contrato. Si usted es un Delegado Autorizado, entonces est√° en el Flujo de Fondos y, por lo tanto, es responsable de la transacci√≥n y su correcta ejecuci√≥n.\nSi usted es una entidad funcional API, entonces no est√° en el Flujo de Fondos, por lo tanto la exposici√≥n legal es baja, pero nunca nula. El riesgo de contraparte es alto, ya que no controla el flujo de la transacci√≥n ni est√° en posesi√≥n de los fondos.\nPara determinar la exposici√≥n legal en cada etapa de la transacci√≥n, necesita tener un Flujo de Fondos definido (firmado), algo como lo que le he compartido, y adem√°s comprender el modelo bajo el cual est√° operando.\nP.18 ¬øC√≥mo evitamos el riesgo regulatorio (por ejemplo, congelaci√≥n de fondos, auditor√≠as)?\nUna auditor√≠a no es un riesgo regulatorio, sino m√°s bien parte integral de hacer negocios en un mundo regulado, por lo que no debe verse como algo que deba evitarse. Solo quer√≠a aclararlo. La congelaci√≥n de fondos ocurre por una de tres razones (estoy siendo muy limitado aqu√≠, aunque las razones pueden ser muchas).\n‚Ä¢ Congelaci√≥n de fondos porque provienen de una billetera o est√°n asociados con una empresa o se dirigen a una billetera o empresa que ha sido se√±alada por alguna raz√≥n. Nunca sabremos el motivo por el que fue se√±alada, basta con decir que se le informar√° que los fondos han sido congelados. Esto es poco com√∫n.\n‚Ä¢ Fondos congelados temporalmente, en espera de documentaci√≥n adicional que se solicita; una vez proporcionada la documentaci√≥n y satisfaciendo a la instituci√≥n que realiz√≥ la congelaci√≥n, los fondos son liberados. Esto puede demorar desde una semana hasta seis meses. No hay promedio. Pero si ocurre una congelaci√≥n de este tipo, usualmente es entre 4 a 6 semanas. Los clientes se registran con conocimiento de esto, es decir, est√°n informados, y se se√±ala en el contrato que firman.\n‚Ä¢ Una orden judicial. Si por alguna raz√≥n se emite una orden judicial o de una entidad gubernamental, los fondos ser√°n congelados y puede que usted sepa o no la raz√≥n detr√°s de la congelaci√≥n. En la mayor√≠a de los casos, una vez que el gobierno congela fondos, rara vez se liberan, y si se liberan, es un proceso extremadamente complicado.\nP.19 ¬øEs legal para nosotros operar como intermediarios financieros dentro de esta estructura?\nSolo si usted tiene licencia como intermediario financiero o como agente/delegado autorizado de uno. Tambi√©n puede operar el negocio sin ser intermediario financiero, pero entonces no estar√≠a en el flujo de fondos, etc. La tabla de ‚ÄúPropietario vs. Agente vs. API‚Äù que cit√© en el enlace del documento que compart√≠ anteriormente lo muestra.\nP.20 ¬øQu√© bancos o PSPs utilizaremos en EE.‚ÄØUU. y en el extranjero?\nEso, por supuesto, es informaci√≥n privilegiada y forma parte del rol que desempe√±o como intermediario y estratega comercial de acuerdos. Tengo mi propio grupo de proveedores de soluciones con los que trabajo; son mis proveedores de confianza para implementar soluciones.\nP.21 ¬øEstos socios bancarios son confiables y experimentados en estos flujos?\nS√≠, por supuesto que lo son. No hay nada excesivamente complicado y/o sofisticado acerca de este flujo de transacciones.\nP.22 ¬øC√≥mo se aseguran los fondos de los clientes? ¬øLas cuentas est√°n segregadas?\nNuevamente, esto depende de c√≥mo se estructura el acuerdo. Cualquier Empresa de Servicios Monetarios con licencia con la que usted trabaje tendr√° una cuenta nominativa segregada con el fin de mantener los fondos separados y garantizar que no haya mezcla de fondos.\nP.23 ¬øQu√© sucede si una transferencia es bloqueada o se√±alada?\nTres posibilidades:\nDevuelta.\nEjecutada, es decir, el dinero se entrega al destino final.\nFondos congelados (como se explic√≥ anteriormente).\nEn cualquiera de los tres escenarios, las partes involucradas intentar√°n descifrar cu√°l fue la raz√≥n del bloqueo o la se√±alizaci√≥n.\nP.24 ¬øCu√°nto tiempo toma lanzar el sistema despu√©s del primer pago?\nDepende de si tiene la tecnolog√≠a lista o no. Pero t√≠picamente (supongamos que tiene un sistema apto para este tipo de transacciones), entonces de 3 a 8 semanas para entrar en operaci√≥n. 3 semanas para un lanzamiento manual, y 8 semanas para un lanzamiento automatizado, siempre que tenga un equipo tecnol√≥gico que lo respalde.\nP.25 ¬øCu√°l es la estructura m√≠nima de personal para operar?\n‚Ä¢ Dos personas. M√≠nimo: Oficial de Cumplimiento (MLRO) y Gerente de Operaciones/Cuentas.\n‚Ä¢ Se recomiendan cuatro: MLRO, Gerente de Operaciones, Soporte al Cliente, Gerente de Cuentas y Especialista Tecnol√≥gico.\nP.26 ¬øQu√© tan automatizado est√° el sistema (en comparaci√≥n con tareas manuales)?\nEl proveedor de soluciones con el que usted termine trabajando puede tener un sistema totalmente automatizado (marca blanca + API), un sistema semi-automatizado (solo APIs) o un sistema 100% manual. Algunos ofrecen los tres. Todo depende de lo que usted contrate. Muy raramente un proveedor le dar√° su soluci√≥n completa marca blanca. Gran parte del mundo trabaja bajo el modelo de mercado API. Creo que debe comenzar de forma manual, comprender muy bien la mec√°nica del negocio y luego construir su soluci√≥n de manera progresiva.\nP.27 ¬øQui√©n maneja el KYC/AML y la conversi√≥n cripto-fiat? ¬øQu√© exchanges/OTCs se utilizan?\nLos operadores con licencia lo hacen. Utilizan los exchanges o socios de liquidez con los que se sienten m√°s c√≥modos.\nP.28 ¬øCu√°nto tarda cada tipo de transacci√≥n (por ejemplo, USDT, enrutamiento fiat)?\nOff-Ramping: 15 minutos a 1 hora (dependiendo de la hora del d√≠a y del d√≠a de la semana).\nRealizaci√≥n de pagos hacia la cuenta nominada del PLH para procesamiento posterior: normalmente un d√≠a, si no menos. No hay actividad de este tipo los fines de semana, fuera del horario bancario o en d√≠as festivos.\nPago posterior (por ejemplo, China, Brasil, UE, etc.): es dif√≠cil de decir, pero normalmente un d√≠a, o seg√∫n corresponda.\nP.29 Dado que necesitaremos vender grandes cantidades de USDT, necesitaremos socios que tengan grandes cantidades de USDT para vender a d√≥lares cada mes. ¬øC√≥mo conseguimos estos?\nLa liquidez de USDT realmente no es un problema. Muchos de los proveedores pueden manejar f√°cilmente entre $100 millones y $200 millones por d√≠a.\nP.30 ¬øCu√°l es el costo mensual total para operar el sistema (licencias, personal, bancos, cumplimiento)?\nUsted no opera el banco, las licencias, ni el cumplimiento. Todo eso es responsabilidad del proveedor de soluciones con el que est√° trabajando y est√° incluido en el costo mensual que le paga, as√≠ como en los cargos comerciales por volumen que se le aplican.\nUsted debe ocuparse de sus propios costos de personal, marketing, soporte al cliente, tecnolog√≠a, prefinanciamiento y el dinero que paga al proveedor de soluciones.\nP.31 ¬øCu√°les son las tarifas por transacci√≥n? ¬øMencion√≥ alrededor del 1%, correcto?\nGeneralmente entre 75 y 80 puntos b√°sicos por transacci√≥n.\nCargo por transacci√≥n, que puede ir desde US$ 1 (m√≠nimo) hasta US$ 2.50 (m√°ximo).\nHabr√° un cargo √∫nico por KYB que var√≠a entre US$ 25 y US$ 75 (dependiendo del proveedor), y\nLos cargos por KYC suelen ser de US$ 2 a US$ 5 por persona.\nEl KYC y KYB se realizan una sola vez y tienen una validez de 12 meses.\nP.32 ¬øYa ha trabajado con esta estructura?\nEsto es lo que hago profesionalmente. Tomo clientes como usted, que tienen una idea de oportunidad de mercado, y dise√±o una soluci√≥n en torno a ella, les encuentro un proveedor con licencia genuino con quien trabajar y estructuro el acuerdo en consecuencia. Para eso son los US$ 15,000.\nP.33 ¬øTiene estudios de caso exitosos?\nNo publico mis estudios de caso. Ning√∫n cliente quiere hacerlo, lo consideran una fuga de su modelo de negocio.\nNo obstante, usted puede investigar sobre m√≠ y lo que he hecho/contribuido en este campo.\nP.34 ¬øHa habido problemas legales o regulatorios en el pasado?\n¬øEn este tipo de configuraci√≥n? Claro. He visto casos en los que los socios comerciales no revelan las se√±ales de alerta que deber√≠an haber sido evidentes para su divulgaci√≥n.\nHe visto clientes proporcionar informaci√≥n ofuscada, lo que conduce a la retenci√≥n de la transacci√≥n, pendiente de la entrega de documentos adicionales.\nHe visto fondos de origen dudoso que fueron devueltos, as√≠ como socios comerciales o de canal que quedaron vetados por una instituci√≥n financiera espec√≠fica.\nDescargo de Responsabilidad Siempre hay problemas. Ver√° de todo cuando trabaje en este campo. Sin embargo, con los controles adecuados, se puede mitigar en gran medida a los actores maliciosos y/o transacciones nefastas.\nEl contenido de este documento se proporciona solo con fines informativos y de planificaci√≥n estrat√©gica.

Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a fintech startup, crypto business, or established financial services company, this collection provides the strategic insights and practical tools needed to successfully obtain and maintain MTL compliance across US jurisdictions.\nüìñ Definition US Money Transmitter Licenses are licenses that are required to operate as a money services business in the United States. The terminology \u0026ldquo;money transmitter\u0026rdquo; is inherently American in nature. Those entities that are classified as a Money Services Business (MSB) in the United States, would be required to obtain a money transmitter license if they fall into the category/classification of a money transmitter. In the United States, a money transmitter is a type of financial institution defined under federal and state laws as any business or individual that engages in the transfer of funds on behalf of the public, either domestically or internationally. This includes accepting currency, monetary value, or other payment instruments from one person and transmitting it to another location or person by any means‚Äîsuch as electronic transfers, wire transfers, or through payment instruments like money orders or stored value cards.\nMoney transmitters are required to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a Money Services Business (MSB) and must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which mandates anti-money laundering (AML) programs, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, such as filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs). Additionally, most states require money transmitters to obtain a separate license to operate within their jurisdiction, ensuring consumer protection and financial integrity. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in severe penalties, including fines and criminal charges. The definition is broad and can encompass traditional remittance services, digital payment platforms, and certain cryptocurrency exchanges, depending on their activities.\nGeneral Information \u0026amp; Guides Foundational resources covering MTL basics, regulatory framework overview, and industry best practices.

It provides substantive operational benefits while building regulatory credibility for future license applications.\nImplementation Timeline \u0026amp; Investment Fast-track operational: 3-8 weeks vs 18-24 months Capital efficient: $10-25K vs $2.2M+ upfront investment Revenue sharing: 12-60 bps based on volume tiers Consulting investment: $15-18K for expert guidance This positioning targets high-intent prospects researching licensing options while demonstrating deep expertise in regulatory strategy and implementation pathways.\nThe Four Key Benefits Here are the four core capabilities you gain as an agent (authorized delegate) ‚Äîall of which aren‚Äôt possible under a pure API/white‚Äëlabel model‚Äîplus a bonus item on speed:\nFlow‚Äëof‚ÄëFunds Control As an agent, you can receive, hold and disburse customer funds in accounts titled to you (often via sub‚Äëaccounts the principal sets up). You‚Äôre in the direct money‚Äëmovement chain, which gives you end‚Äëto‚Äëend visibility and the ability to manage timing, settlement rails and reconciliation yourself. Own KYC/KYB Program You onboard and verify customers under your own compliance policies. That means your name appears on all KYC documentation, you set risk thresholds and you own the customer due‚Äëdiligence process‚Äîversus simply passing data through someone else‚Äôs system. Direct Correspondent Agreements You negotiate and sign settlement or payout contracts (e.g., with PayPal, Cash App or other remitters) in your own name. The principal co‚Äësigns or authorises you, but the agreement sits on your letterhead and binds you directly. Branded Customer Relationship All client‚Äëfacing contracts, terms of service and user‚Äëinterfaces carry your brand and legal entity. You own the contractual relationship with end‚Äëcustomers‚Äîpricing, SLAs, support level‚Äîrather than having customers contract with the principal behind the scenes. Bonus: Rapid Go‚ÄëLive Timeline Because you‚Äôre piggy‚Äëbacking off an existing license rather than building one yourself, you can be operational as an agent in 4-8 weeks (often as quickly as 2-3 weeks). That includes due‚Äëdiligence, legal paperwork and bank‚Äëaccount setup‚Äîversus the 18‚Äì24 months needed to apply for, bond and secure your own state‚Äëby‚Äëstate licenses.\nLicensing Path Comparison ‚Äî Expanded Detail Capability / Right| **Hold Your Own State MTLs\n** You are the primary licensee in each state| **Act as an Agent / Authorized Delegate\n** You operate under a principal‚Äôs license| **Pure API / White‚ÄëLabel (Non‚ÄëAgent)\n**You simply ‚Äúskin‚Äù another provider‚Äôs platform Flow of funds Full control. You may receive, hold and disburse client money directly in your own bank accounts. Permitted, but supervised. Funds can sit in accounts titled to you (often sub‚Äëaccounts) as long as they remain within the principal‚Äôs regulatory perimeter. Prohibited. All money must go straight from the principal to the end‚Äëbeneficiary; you never touch the funds. KYC / KYB Mandatory. You must build and maintain your own customer‚Äëdue‚Äëdiligence program. Allowed / expected. You can onboard clients and run KYC/KYB, subject to the principal‚Äôs policy and audits. Not allowed. The principal owns all onboarding and verification; you merely pass through data. Correspondent agreements (e.g., PayPal, Cash App) Direct signing. You negotiate and execute settlement or payout contracts in your own name. Direct, but co‚Äësigned. You may contract with correspondents, yet the principal must counter‚Äësign or formally authorize each agreement. Principal only. Any correspondent contract must be executed by‚Äîand in the name of‚Äîthe license holder. Customer relationship \u0026amp; branding Full brand ownership. Contracts, T\u0026amp;Cs and UI carry your logo and legal entity. ‚ÄúDigital franchise.‚Äù Your brand is front‚Äëand‚Äëcentre, but must reference the principal license in disclosures. Masked reseller. Your app may look branded, but legally the customer belongs to the principal. Regulatory track‚Äërecord High. Regulators see you as the licensee‚Äîvaluable history when expanding. Medium‚Äëhigh. Examiners see your transaction data through the principal; useful when you later apply for your own MTLs. Low. Limited visibility; future license applications start almost from scratch. Access to Banking You would have to arrange for segregated named account banking to get a fully functioning license. You would be expected to have a bank account and in some cases, the PLH can provide a sub-account to you. You would be expected to have a bank account for your financial activities, the Sponsor will provide a settlement account, but funds will only be pushed to your named account. Settlement accounts Open freely. You establish your own NOSTRO/treasury accounts in any currency. Open with the principal‚Äôs blessing. Often achieved via named sub‚Äëaccounts at the principal‚Äôs bank. None. Settlement happens inside the principal‚Äôs banking stack. Transactions \u0026amp; Activities Allowed? Whatever you have filed with the state regulator as part of your business plan. That business plan defines the umbrella coverage of what you would be allowed to conduct as far as business activities are concerned. The Principal License Holder generally will ‚Äúprogram‚Äù the activities and transactions allowed into their Authorized Delegate (Agent) Contact with you. Typically you are either partially or fully subscribing to the Transactions \u0026amp; Activities allowed to the PLH by the state regulator and/or you can also add to those transactions and activities by adding your own, with the prior approval of the PLH.| You are limited to the Transactions \u0026amp; Activities allowed by the Sponsor via their API. Anything outside of it would generally not be allowed / accommodated.\nImplementation timeline| 18‚Äì24 months (application prep, bonding, state reviews).| 3‚Äì8 weeks (due‚Äëdiligence packet ‚Üí live processing).| 1‚Äì4 weeks (API keys and basic compliance checks).\nUp‚Äëfront cost| ‚âà USD 2.2 million (surety bonds, legal, compliance team).| USD 10‚Äì25 k onboarding fee.

The authorized delegate path offers a compelling middle ground that most operators overlook or misunderstand, providing genuine operational control while avoiding the capital intensity of full licensure. However, success depends heavily on selecting the right principal license holder, structuring proper agreements, and maintaining compliance standards that support future growth. For companies serious about building sustainable, regulated payment infrastructure, expert guidance through this decision framework isn\u0026rsquo;t optional‚Äîit\u0026rsquo;s the difference between a costly misstep and a strategic foundation that scales.

You may need an MTL if you:\n‚úÖ Facilitate Money Transfers ‚Äì Your business moves funds between individuals or accounts.\n‚úÖ Operate a Crypto Exchange or Wallet ‚Äì Most U.S. states classify crypto transactions as money transmission.\n‚úÖ Provide Payment Processing Services ‚Äì Handling customer payments may require licensing.\n‚úÖ Issue Prepaid Cards or Digital Wallets ‚Äì Any stored-value service could fall under money transmission laws.\n‚ö†Ô∏è Exemptions : Some businesses, such as banks, certain fintechs, or agents of a licensed entity, may not require an MTL. Consult a compliance expert before proceeding.\nStep 2: Research State-Specific MTL Requirements In the U.S., money transmitter licenses are issued at the state level. This means:\nYou must apply separately in each state where you operate. Requirements differ by state, with some having stricter financial and compliance mandates than others. Some states exempt certain businesses based on transaction volume or service type. üìù Pro Tip : Use the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) to streamline applications for multiple states.\nStep 3: Prepare Your Business for Licensing 1. Register with FinCEN (Federal Requirement) All money services businesses (MSBs) must register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Registration is done online and must be renewed every two years. 2. Establish an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance Program Develop a formal AML policy that aligns with Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements. Hire or designate a Compliance Officer to oversee AML and regulatory requirements. Implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring systems. 3. Maintain Financial Reserves (Surety Bond Requirement) Most states require a surety bond ranging from $50,000 to $500,000+ , depending on the state and transaction volume. This bond acts as financial protection for customers in case of business failure. 4. Meet Minimum Net Worth Requirements Some states require businesses to hold a minimum capital reserve , typically between $100,000 and $1 million. Step 4: Gather Required Documents To apply for an MTL, you will need:\nüìå Company Registration Documents ‚Äì Articles of incorporation, business licenses, and organizational structure.\nüìå Financial Statements ‚Äì Audited financials, proof of net worth, and tax records.\nüìå AML \u0026amp; KYC Compliance Documents ‚Äì Compliance program details, policies, and officer credentials.\nüìå Background Checks ‚Äì Key executives and owners must undergo criminal and financial background checks.\nüìå Surety Bond Proof ‚Äì Documentation proving your company has secured the necessary financial bond.\nStep 5: Submit the MTL Application Once you\u0026rsquo;ve gathered all necessary documentation:\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Apply via the NMLS (where applicable) ‚Äì Many states use the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) for online applications.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Submit individual state applications where NMLS is not available.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Pay the application fees , which vary by state but typically range from $1,000 to $5,000 per license.\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Await state approval , which can take 6-24 months , depending on the state‚Äôs backlog and your application‚Äôs completeness.\nStep 6: Undergo Regulatory Review \u0026amp; Approval After submission, the state regulatory agency will:\n‚úîÔ∏è Review your application for completeness and compliance.\n‚úîÔ∏è Assess financial stability and verify surety bond coverage.\n‚úîÔ∏è Conductbackground checks on key company executives.\n‚úîÔ∏è Possibly request an in-person interview or additional documentation.\nOnce approved, you will receive your official MTL , allowing you to operate legally in that state.\nStep 7: Maintain Compliance \u0026amp; Renew Licenses Once licensed, businesses must continuously comply with regulatory requirements, including:\nüîÑ Annual Renewals ‚Äì Most states require MTL renewals every 1-2 years , with updated financial records.\nüìã Regular Reporting ‚Äì Submit financial reports, AML compliance updates, and transaction data as required by the state.\n‚ö†Ô∏è Ongoing AML Audits ‚Äì Conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering laws.\nüí° Failure to comply can result in fines, license suspension, or revocation.\nHow Much Does an MTL Cost? Cost Component Estimated Cost (Per State) Application Fee $1,000 - $5,000 Surety Bond $50,000 - $500,000+ Legal \u0026amp; Compliance Costs $20,000 - $100,000+ Annual Renewal Fees $500 - $2,500 For a nationwide MTL strategy , businesses should budget at least $2 million - $5 million in licensing and compliance costs.\nAlternatives to MTLs: Sponsorship \u0026amp; Partnerships Because obtaining an MTL is expensive and time-consuming , many startups and fintechs explore alternative strategies :\n1Ô∏è‚É£ License Sponsorship ‚Äì Partnering with an existing licensed money transmitter to operate under their license.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Bank Partnerships ‚Äì Some fintechs operate through banks, leveraging their licenses for payments.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ MSB Agents ‚Äì Registering as an agent under an existing licensed entity , rather than holding your own MTL.\nüí° These alternatives allow businesses to operate faster but come with revenue-sharing and contractual obligations.\nConclusion: Securing an MTL for Long-Term Success A Money Transmitter License (MTL) is an essential requirement for businesses in money transfers, crypto, fintech, and payment processing. While the licensing process is complex, securing an MTL provides:\n‚úîÔ∏è Legitimacy \u0026amp; trust in financial markets.\n‚úîÔ∏è Legal protection from regulatory penalties.\n‚úîÔ∏è Access to a larger market , allowing national or multi-state operations.\nFor companies serious about long-term growth in financial services , obtaining an MTL is a strategic investment that ensures compliance, security, and operational success.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/how-to-obtain-a-money-transmitter-license-mtl-step-by-step-guide/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eObtaining a Money Transmitter License (MTL) is a complex, multi-step process that varies by jurisdiction, particularly in the United States, where each state has its own requirements.

Here\u0026rsquo;s a detailed explanation:\nUnderstanding Money Transmitter Licenses Definition : A money transmitter license is a legal requirement for businesses that engage in the transfer of money or provide payment services. This is regulated both at the federal and state level. Federal Regulation : At the federal level, money transmitters must register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and comply with regulations like the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering (AML) laws. State Regulation : Each state has its own criteria for what constitutes money transmission and requires a separate license. The requirements vary widely from state to state. RBPP and Money Transmitter Licenses Direct Payment Services : If an RBPP service directly handles customer funds ‚Äì for example, if it collects money from a customer and then pays it to a biller ‚Äì it\u0026rsquo;s more likely to be classified as a money transmission service. This would generally require a money transmitter license. Bill Payment Through Financial Institutions : If the RBPP service is merely facilitating payments through existing financial institutions (like banks) and doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly handle the transfer of funds, it might not require a money transmitter license. In this case, the financial institution\u0026rsquo;s licensing would cover the regulatory requirements. Service Structure Matters : The necessity for a license also depends on whether the RBPP service is acting as an intermediary in the payment process or just providing a technological platform for transactions. Examples Direct Handling of Funds : An RBPP service that collects payments from users and then distributes these to various billers may be classified as a money transmitter. Payment Facilitation Only : An online platform that simply facilitates the payment process by linking customers with their existing bank accounts for bill payments might not be considered a money transmitter. Conclusion Whether an RBPP service in the U.S. requires a money transmitter license depends on the nature of its operations, particularly how it handles customer funds. It is advisable for businesses to consult with legal experts specializing in financial regulations to determine their specific licensing requirements. This ensures compliance with both state and federal laws, which is crucial in the heavily regulated financial services sector.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/does-remote-bill-presentment-and-payment-in-the-united-states-require-a-money-transmitter-license/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn the United States, whether remote bill presentment and payment (RBPP) services require a money transmitter license depends on the specifics of the service and how it\u0026rsquo;s structured.

Here are some key points to consider:\nBasic ATM Services : If the ATM is only dispensing cash and accepting deposits, this typically does not require a money transmitter license. These services are generally considered part of traditional banking activities. Money Transmitter License : A money transmitter license is typically required for businesses that are involved in transferring money or converting currency.

Whether you\u0026rsquo;re looking to help friends and family send money overseas or build a larger cross-border money transfer service, there are some crucial legal and regulatory aspects you need to understand.\nKey Takeaways:\nMoney transmission requires a license: If you act as a financial intermediary, facilitating money transfers between others, you are considered a money services business (MSB) and¬†need a money transmitter license in¬†each state you operate in. Federal registration is mandatory: You must register with the¬†Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) at the federal level. Nationwide operations require 50 state licenses: Many MSBs obtain licenses in all 50 states to operate across the US. No statute of limitations: The government can prosecute unlicensed money transmission activities¬†regardless of how long ago they occurred. Penalties for unlicensed operations are severe: These include fines, cease-and-desist orders, and even jail time. Failure to comply with regulations can lead to serious consequences: This includes disregarding anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws, ignoring Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions, and failing to conduct proper checks. Essential Steps for Starting a Legal Money Transfer Business:\nUnderstand MSB laws and regulations: Thoroughly research state and federal requirements, including license applications, registration processes, and compliance protocols. Obtain a money transmitter license: Apply for and obtain licenses in each state you plan to operate. Register with FinCEN: Complete the federal registration process with FinCEN. Establish a compliance program: Implement anti-money laundering and terrorist financing measures, including OFAC sanctions screening and customer due diligence. Seek legal guidance: Consult with an experienced lawyer specializing in financial regulations for comprehensive advice and support. Remember: Operating a money transfer business without the proper licenses and compliance measures can result in significant legal and financial consequences. By following these essential steps and staying informed about regulations, you can build a safe and successful business in the US money transfer industry.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/starting-a-money-transfer-business-in-the-us/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"what-you-need-to-know\"\u003eWhat You Need to Know\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you interested in starting a money transfer business in the US?\u003c/strong\u003e Whether you\u0026rsquo;re looking to help friends and family send money overseas or build a larger cross-border money transfer service, there are some crucial legal and regulatory aspects you need to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKey Takeaways:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMoney transmission requires a license:\u003c/strong\u003e ¬†If you act as a financial intermediary, facilitating money transfers between others, you are considered a money services business (MSB) and¬†\u003cstrong\u003eneed a money transmitter license\u003c/strong\u003e ¬†in¬†\u003cstrong\u003eeach state\u003c/strong\u003e ¬†you operate in.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFederal registration is mandatory:\u003c/strong\u003e ¬†You must register with the¬†\u003cstrong\u003eFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)\u003c/strong\u003e ¬†at the federal level.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNationwide operations require 50 state licenses:\u003c/strong\u003e ¬†Many MSBs obtain licenses in all 50 states to operate across the US.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo statute of limitations:\u003c/strong\u003e ¬†The government can prosecute unlicensed money transmission activities¬†\u003cstrong\u003eregardless of how long ago they occurred.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePenalties for unlicensed operations are severe:\u003c/strong\u003e ¬†These include fines, cease-and-desist orders, and even jail time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFailure to comply with regulations can lead to serious consequences:\u003c/strong\u003e ¬†This includes disregarding anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws, ignoring Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions, and failing to conduct proper checks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEssential Steps for Starting a Legal Money Transfer Business:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Starting a Money Transfer Business in the US"},{"content":"Comprehensive Shifts in the Sponsorship Dynamics of Money Services Businesses (MSBs) in the U.S. Traditional Models and the Inception of Regulatory Revisions Historically, the establishment and operation of money services businesses in the United States allowed for a relatively straightforward model for agents to function under established entities. Take, for instance, a licensed entity named \u0026ldquo;Acme Money Transfer\u0026rdquo;, which could smoothly run its operations using a dedicated domain, such as \u0026ldquo;acmemoneytransfer.com\u0026rdquo;. New entrants (i.e. authorized agents of Acme), like an illustrative agent named Peter, had the capacity to form their own platforms, for example, \u0026ldquo;petermoneytransfer.com\u0026rdquo;, while being formally affiliated with Acme, providing services with pertinent disclaimers highlighting Acme\u0026rsquo;s provision. However, the waters have been stirred by a tangible regulatory change emanating initially from California, fundamentally altering the permissible domain structures for agents.\nThe In-depth Ramifications of Domain Structure Alterations Agents like Peter are now enveloped by a regulatory mandate to house their services directly on the primary license holder‚Äôs domain, manifesting either as a subdomain or a subdirectory. This translates into structuring as ‚Äúpeter.acmemoneytransfer.com‚Äù or ‚Äúacmemoneytransfer.com/peter‚Äù. Consequently, the initial agent domain (like ‚Äúpetermoneytransfer.com‚Äù) would be subject to discontinuation or redirection to the newly configured URL nested under Acme‚Äôs domain. This regulatory adaptation, while originating from California\u0026rsquo;s governing body, is anticipated to permeate through to other states, thereby crafting a unified rule applicable even when agents operate across diverse states, such as Arizona or Florida.\nUnpacking Queries and Adhering to Compliance Standards Under the new regulatory framework, entities are expressly prohibited from operating as an autonomous money transfer service on a distinct domain, even whilst underpinning an agent relationship. Any divergence from the redirection to the licensed holder‚Äôs domain poses a risk of encountering stringent regulatory intervention, inclusive of potential shutdowns by regulators. Agents are now corralled into a streamlined model where services are offered exclusively under the domain of the license holder, ensuring an overt and auditable link between the agent and the license holder.\nGazing into Potential Future Regulatory Developments The trajectory and persistence of this policy alteration remain shrouded in a veil of uncertainty, with the potential for additional evolution in the ensuing years. Notably, the firm regulatory posture adopted by California\u0026rsquo;s authorities implicitly nudges entities towards obtaining their individual licenses, steering clear from the prior agent model.\nExpanding the Lens to Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) While the present regulatory perturbations do not exert a direct impact on Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) providers, there lurks a prospective reality where similar domain restrictions could unfurl onto BaaS providers in the foreseeable future. This could cascade into implications for services extended by major banking conglomerates like Citibank or JPMorgan Chase, especially if they navigate towards a similar agent-centric operational model.\nForging Ahead: Guidance for Entities Entities and prospective agents are implored to immerse themselves in a meticulous understanding of these sweeping regulatory changes, prior to devising and executing operational and business trajectories. A vigil stance on forthcoming regulatory metamorphoses is imperative to ensure that services remain unfailingly compliant with impending policy recalibrations. This pivotal juncture heralds a marked inflection point in the operational schema of money service businesses and their agents, underscoring the imperativeness of adhering to new regulatory paradigms to ensure resilient, compliant, and sustainable operations moving forward.\nWhy this change? Many people have been asking why there has been a noticeable shift in the California regulator\u0026rsquo;s stance on domain-related issues pertaining to agents. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive deeper into this.\nIn the past, being an agent for a money transfer operator implied that you had a physical store. This store would bear the branding of the operator, displaying logos and other standardized signage. It was designed to clearly indicate that you were an affiliate or payout location for the money transfer service. As an agent, you couldn\u0026rsquo;t advertise or promote any other company, nor could you offer your own services. Everything you presented had to align with the money transfer company you represented.\nThis same principle is now being applied to the online realm. Regulators don\u0026rsquo;t want agents to have unrestricted control over their online domains where they might make claims about being a FinTech company offering various services. Instead, the regulators aim to ensure that the main money transfer or financial service company, which holds the official license, has complete authority over the content on these domains. The goal is to prevent agents from offering or advertising services that the primary license holder doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide.\nIn essence, regulators are drawing from the traditional model of physical agent stores and applying the same rules and expectations to the digital world, ensuring that agents remain true to the services of the principal license holder online. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just a trend in California, but is becoming more widespread.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/advisory-guidance-on-domain-naming-for-authorized-agents-operating-under-us-money-transmitter-licenses-in-online-businesses/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"comprehensive-shifts-in-the-sponsorship-dynamics-of-money-services-businesses-msbs-in-the-us\"\u003eComprehensive Shifts in the Sponsorship Dynamics of Money Services Businesses (MSBs) in the U.S.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"traditional-models-and-the-inception-of-regulatory-revisions\"\u003eTraditional Models and the Inception of Regulatory Revisions\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHistorically, the establishment and operation of money services businesses in the United States allowed for a relatively straightforward model for agents to function under established entities.

This could resemble putting your domain and logo on a Google Mail and Google Work setup, without changing anything else. That‚Äôs pretty straightforward.\nHowever, sponsorship is the option that captivates most individuals. Here, you approach a company with money transmitter licenses and propose, for instance, incorporating \u0026lsquo;acmemoneytransfer.com\u0026rsquo;. They may activate it while keeping you away from the fund\u0026rsquo;s flow, with the details delineated. This can lead to a pathway to becoming an authorized agent, perhaps eventually, and you might undergo a new license application.\nIt‚Äôs vital to recall a recent incident involving the California Money Transmitter License regulator, one of the most formidable regulatory bodies in the US. Their decision to alter certain practices in remittance services has injected a level of complication into plans. The scenario: if I, Faisal, have a license and use faisalkhan.com, you could request the usage of acmemoneytransfer.com. I might clone my existing setup, altering only the logo and naming to acmemoneytransfer.com and indicating Acme Money Transfer operates it under my license, which was previously permissible.\nHowever, the California regulator has introduced a new regulation: they permit as many websites as desired (such as FaisalKhan.com and acmemoneytransfer.com), but under the condition that the Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs) and directors of faisalkhan.com must be identical to those on acmemoneytransfer.com, which typically isn\u0026rsquo;t the scenario. This regulatory shift has spiraled things. Presently, only banks offer sponsorship and it involves using APIs and negotiation since each signup may cost a hefty one-time fee.\nCircling back to the Authorized Agent model (as can be seen in the Summary of Money Transmitter License) - the California regulator is agreeable to the likes of acmemoneytransfer.com and other domains only if they become actual authorized agents. This resembles becoming a mini license holder, lending legitimacy and order to everything. A widespread misconception is that being an agent is heavily regulated. To debunk this, consider the limited regulation on a comic or tobacco shop becoming a Western Union agent, thanks to the systems handling most compliance tasks. The same principle applies when becoming an authorized agent in the money transfer domain.\nUp until last week, I advised opting for remittance as a service. However, with my providers now retracting contracts where remittance as a service was being offered, I\u0026rsquo;ve halted that advice. New contracts are being drawn, stipulating that we will be the principal license holder and you will serve as our agent, the only arrangement that is currently viable going forward.\nThe lingering question is how widespread this California decision will become, given that states like Pennsylvania, Nevada, and New Mexico often echo its regulatory shifts. As of now, this has affected around nine or ten money transmitter services in California as a result of an audit review, initially of a particular client, which then permeated through to others. How fast this becomes a standardized policy for all auditors in California and potentially permeates into other US states is yet to be determined. Nevertheless, we\u0026rsquo;ve been granted not only a problem but also a solution by the regulator, so the forthcoming trajectory will be insightful to observe\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/advisory-sponsorship-vs-agent-status/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAlright, beginning with the far-right concept of a white label (refer to this table: \u003ca href=\"https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/summary-table-us-money-transmitter-license/\"\u003eSummary of Money Transmitter License\u003c/a\u003e), it signifies a service being offered \u0026ldquo;as is\u0026rdquo; - no changes to the flow of funds or visual alterations are possible.

state in the US that does not have a specific money transmitter license. However, this does not mean that money transmitters do not need any licenses in Montana. In fact, the Montana Division of Banking and Financial Institutions (Division) has stated that money transmitters may need to obtain other types of licenses in order to operate in the state, depending on the specific activities they are engaged in.\nFor example, a money transmitter that offers escrow services would need to obtain an escrow license. A money transmitter that offers consumer loans would need to obtain a consumer finance company license. And a money transmitter that offers retail sales financing would need to obtain a retail sales finance company license.\nThe Division has also stated that money transmitters may need to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money services business (MSB).\nThe official definition of a money transmitter in Montana is not defined in state law. However, the Division uses the FinCEN definition of an MSB, which is \u0026ldquo;any person doing business in one or more of the following activities: exchanging currency; transferring funds; or issuing payment instruments.\u0026rdquo;\nThe following are some examples of activities that would be considered money transmission in Montana:\nSelling or redeeming traveler\u0026rsquo;s checks or money orders Issuing or selling stored-value cards Transmitting money through a wire transfer service Exchanging virtual currency for fiat currency If you are unsure whether your business activities require a license in Montana, you should consult with an attorney.\nHow to operate in the state of Montana without a money transmitter license\nIf you are a money transmitter and you do not need to obtain a specific license in Montana, you can still operate in the state by registering with FinCEN as an MSB.\nTo register with FinCEN, you must complete and submit a Form FinCEN-114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR). You can register online at the FinCEN website.\nOnce you are registered with FinCEN, you will need to file an annual report, Form FinCEN-114a, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR).\nConclusion\nMontana is unique in the United States for not requiring a specific money transmitter license. However, based on their activities, money transmitters in Montana might need to secure other forms of licensing. Additionally, they are required to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a Money Services Business (MSB). If you\u0026rsquo;re uncertain about the licensing needs for your business in Montana, it\u0026rsquo;s advisable to consult with an attorney.\nThe following are some legal sources in the state of Montana that you may need to know about if you are a money transmitter:\nMontana Banking and Financial Institutions Act: This law contains the general provisions governing the Division of Banking and Financial Institutions, including the Division\u0026rsquo;s authority to license and regulate money transmitters. Montana Consumer Finance Act: This law contains the specific provisions governing consumer finance companies, including licensing requirements. Montana Retail Sales Finance Act: This law contains the specific provisions governing retail sales finance companies, including licensing requirements. Montana Escrow Act: This law contains the specific provisions governing escrow companies, including licensing requirements. FinCEN Regulations: FinCEN has issued a number of regulations that apply to MSBs, including regulations on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing. You can find these legal sources on the websites of the Montana Division of Banking and Financial Institutions and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\nIn addition to the above legal sources, you may also want to consult with an attorney to discuss your specific situation and to ensure that you are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/money-transmitter-license-in-the-state-of-montana-the-abridged-version/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMontana is the only state in the US that does not have a specific money transmitter license.

This is particularly true for foreign Money Services Businesses (MSBs) looking to expand their operations into the United States. This article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory requirements for foreign MSBs operating in the U.S., the costs associated with compliance, and potential alternatives for conducting business.\nRegulatory Requirements for Foreign MSBs in the U.S. In 2012, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a ruling stating that foreign MSBs, whether financial or non-financial entities, conducting business in the U.S. would be subject to the same licensing requirements as domestic entities. This means that foreign MSBs must obtain licenses in each state where they intend to do business, including all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nThe Cost of Compliance Obtaining licenses in the U.S. is a costly and time-consuming process. Depending on the nature of the business, the total cost, including demonstrating sufficient net worth, hiring a compliance officer, establishing a physical office, and undergoing audits, can reach upwards of $2.5 million. The process can take anywhere from one to two years to complete.\nBusiness Model Considerations The specific nature of an MSB\u0026rsquo;s operations can significantly impact its regulatory obligations. For instance, a business that exclusively deals in cryptocurrency and does not handle fiat currency may be exempt from licensing requirements in several states. However, this exemption is subject to two important caveats:\nThe exemption only applies to businesses that facilitate cryptocurrency transactions via a licensed provider and do not directly handle fiat currency. The exemption does not cover all states. For example, while California may exempt such businesses, New York does not. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that these exemptions pertain only to money transmission laws and do not extend to regulations enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe Importance of Legal Opinions Given the complexity and variability of regulatory requirements, it is highly recommended that businesses obtain a legal opinion from an attorney before proceeding. This legal memo serves as a form of insurance, providing a detailed analysis of the business\u0026rsquo;s regulatory obligations based on its specific operations and the current legal landscape. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial that businesses own this opinion and are able to publish it on their website.\nIn addition to a legal opinion, businesses may also seek a \u0026ldquo;no action\u0026rdquo; letter from the regulator, which essentially states that the regulator will not take enforcement action based on the business\u0026rsquo;s current operations.\nAlternatives to Licensing For businesses seeking a faster and potentially less costly route to market, partnering with an existing license holder can be an attractive option. This approach, often referred to as \u0026ldquo;white labeling,\u0026rdquo; allows the business to operate under the license holder\u0026rsquo;s brand, thereby bypassing the need for individual state licenses. However, this approach comes with its own set of considerations:\nThe U.S. does not allow \u0026ldquo;passporting\u0026rdquo; of clients. This means that if a business eventually obtains its own licenses and wishes to transition its clients from the license holder, it may need to re-verify the clients\u0026rsquo; identities. The license holder will likely require a revenue share agreement, which may not be agreeable to all businesses. Conclusion Navigating the U.S. regulatory landscape as a foreign MSB can be likened to traversing a complex maze. Each turn represents a different state with its own set of rules and requirements. The journey can be long and costly, but with careful planning, sound legal advice, and strategic partnerships, it is possible to reach the end successfully. As the financial services landscape continues to evolve, so too will the regulatory environment, making it all the more important for businesses to stay informed and adaptable.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/navigating-the-regulatory-landscape-for-foreign-money-services-businesses-in-the-u-s/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the rapidly evolving world of financial services, businesses often find themselves navigating complex regulatory landscapes.

Given the prevalence of this query, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial for us to address the topic of \u0026ldquo;money transmitter license rent\u0026rdquo; in detail and dispel any lingering uncertainties.\nTo be direct, the answer to the question, \u0026ldquo;Can we rent or lease a money transmitter license in the United States?\u0026rdquo; is a resounding no. However, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to explore this in depth to understand the reasoning behind it and shed light on the alternatives available for those aspiring to operate within the regulated financial framework.\nIn the past, some businesses tried to rent or lease licenses from principal license holders. State regulators, however, have since cracked down on these practices, deeming them illegal. Regulators insist that companies cannot simply approach existing principal license holders to effectively rent out their licenses.\nA key example highlighting this regulatory clampdown is the 2013-14 action against the company PreCash, a case that serves as a stark warning against such practices. You can read more about this in a detailed report available under the sub-heading \u0026ldquo;Authorized Delegate\u0026rdquo;. This case emphasizes the regulators\u0026rsquo; stance and the potential repercussions for those attempting to circumnavigate the rules.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to clarify the industry terminology surrounding this issue. Phrases like \u0026ldquo;rent a license\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;lease a license\u0026rdquo; are widely discouraged. Instead, when engaging with someone about the potential use of their license, more appropriate terms to use involve \u0026ldquo;regulatory coverage\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;licensing umbrella\u0026rdquo;.\nFor example, you might ask, \u0026ldquo;Is it possible to get regulatory coverage by working with you?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Can we come under a licensing umbrella by working with you?\u0026rdquo; These terms signify an intention to form a legal partnership with the principal license holder (PLH), rather than an attempt to dodge the legal requirements.\nIn a legitimate partnership with a PLH, the goal is to contribute business or subscribe to a core service they offer, such as payment processing, segregated name accounts, point of sale terminals, or ACH processing. By doing so, an alliance is formed with the PLH, who would then manage the program, thereby providing the necessary regulatory coverage.\nTo sum up, the idea of \u0026ldquo;money transmitter license rent\u0026rdquo; is not legally recognized. Instead, the advisable strategy is to partner with an existing PLH to gain the required regulatory coverage. The sincerity of this partnership and the resulting operations are what regulators will focus on, rather than the unsuitable renting or leasing of licenses.\nWe hope this clarifies any misconceptions around the renting or leasing of money transmitter licenses.

Money transmitter license agents play a vital role in facilitating financial transactions on behalf of licensed money transmitters. In this article, we will delve into the concept of a money transmitter license agent, their responsibilities, prerequisites, and their association with the money transmitter license.\nWhat is a Money Transmitter License Agent? A money transmitter license agent is an individual or entity authorized to conduct certain financial activities on behalf of a licensed money transmitter. Money transmitters are businesses that provide services such as money transfers, check cashing, and currency exchange. These businesses are required to obtain a money transmitter license to operate legally in the United States.\nResponsibilities of a Money Transmitter License Agent: As an agent of a money transmitter license holder, individuals or entities have specific responsibilities. These may include:\nCustomer Transactions: Agents facilitate financial transactions for customers, including sending and receiving money, converting currency, and cashing checks. They act as intermediaries between the licensed money transmitter and the customer. Compliance: Agents are responsible for adhering to the anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations set forth by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). They must ensure that all transactions are conducted in compliance with these regulations, verifying customer identities and reporting suspicious activities if necessary. Record-Keeping: Agents maintain accurate records of transactions conducted on behalf of the licensed money transmitter. This includes detailed information such as the amount, date, and purpose of each transaction, as well as customer identification details. Prerequisites to Becoming an Agent: To become an agent, individuals or entities must meet certain prerequisites, which may vary by state. Typically, the requirements include:\nLicensing: Agents must hold a valid and active money transmitter license issued by the appropriate state regulatory authority. The licensing process often involves submitting an application, paying the required fees, and satisfying specific eligibility criteria. Background Checks: Agents are subject to thorough background checks, which may include criminal history and financial background investigations. These checks are performed to ensure the agent\u0026rsquo;s trustworthiness and suitability for handling financial transactions. Association with the Money Transmitter License: Agents operate under the umbrella of a licensed money transmitter. The money transmitter license holder, also known as the principal, is responsible for overseeing and supervising the activities of its agents. The principal is accountable for ensuring that its agents comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nIn conclusion, agents play a vital role in the money services business landscape in the United States. As intermediaries between licensed money transmitters and customers, they facilitate financial transactions and ensure compliance with AML and KYC regulations. By meeting specific prerequisites and operating under the authority of a money transmitter license, agents contribute to the smooth functioning of the industry while maintaining the integrity and security of financial transactions.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/money-transmitter-license-agent/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"understanding-the-role-of-a-money-transmitter-license-agent-in-the-united-states\"\u003eUnderstanding the Role of a Money Transmitter License Agent in the United States\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the realm of \u003ca href=\"https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-services-business-msb/\"\u003emoney services businesses\u003c/a\u003e (\u003ca href=\"https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-services-business-msb/\"\u003eMSBs\u003c/a\u003e) in the United States, a crucial component of the industry is the role of a money transmitter license agent.

However, for certain businesses, the process of obtaining a license can be complex and time-consuming. This is where license sponsorship comes into play. In this article, we will explore the concept of money transmitter license sponsorship, how it works, and its implications for businesses.\nUnderstanding Money Transmitter License Sponsorship Money transmitter license sponsorship refers to an arrangement wherein a licensed entity (the sponsor) agrees to allow another business (the sponsored company) to operate under its license. In other words, the sponsored company leverages the sponsor\u0026rsquo;s license to engage in money transmission activities without having to obtain its own license from scratch.\nHow Does License Sponsorship Work? Identification of a Sponsor: The first step in the license sponsorship process is finding a suitable sponsor. The sponsored company must seek out a licensed entity that is willing to sponsor its money transmitter license. This can be a financial institution or an established MSB with a valid license in the relevant state(s) where the sponsored company intends to operate. Due Diligence: Once a potential sponsor is identified, both parties engage in a due diligence process. The sponsor evaluates the sponsored company\u0026rsquo;s business model, compliance procedures, financial stability, and risk management practices. The sponsored company must demonstrate its ability to operate in compliance with the legal and regulatory requirements governing money transmission. Agreement and Documentation: If the sponsor determines that the sponsored company is a suitable candidate, they enter into a formal agreement outlining the terms and conditions of the sponsorship arrangement. This agreement typically covers the responsibilities of both parties, the scope of operations permitted under the sponsorship, and any fees or revenue-sharing arrangements. Regulatory Approval: After the agreement is finalized, the sponsored company submits an application for regulatory approval to the relevant state authority (this is usually optional). The application includes documentation related to the sponsorship arrangement, demonstrating that the sponsored company will operate under the supervision and compliance framework of the sponsor\u0026rsquo;s license. Ongoing Compliance and Reporting: Once approved, the sponsored company must adhere to the regulatory requirements and reporting obligations set forth by the licensing authority. This includes submitting regular reports, maintaining adequate anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, and complying with other relevant regulations. Benefits and Considerations Expedited Licensing: Money transmitter license sponsorship offers an expedited pathway for businesses seeking to enter the money transmission industry. It allows them to bypass the lengthy process of obtaining a license from scratch, potentially saving time and resources. Compliance Support: Sponsored companies benefit from the expertise and established compliance infrastructure of the sponsor. They can leverage the sponsor\u0026rsquo;s systems, policies, and procedures to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Oversight and Accountability: License sponsorship ensures that the sponsored company operates within a framework of established regulations. The sponsor holds responsibility for overseeing and monitoring the operations of the sponsored company to ensure compliance. Financial Implications: The sponsorship arrangement may involve upfront fees, ongoing payments, or revenue sharing between the sponsor and the sponsored company. The financial terms are typically negotiated and documented in the agreement between the parties. In conclusion, money transmitter license sponsorship provides a streamlined option for businesses looking to engage in money transmission activities without the need to obtain their own license. By partnering with a licensed entity, the sponsored company can leverage the sponsor\u0026rsquo;s expertise, compliance framework, and established systems. However, it is essential for both parties to conduct thorough due diligence and ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements. With proper planning and execution, license sponsorship can be a viable strategy for businesses entering the money services industry.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/money-transmitter-license-sponsor/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"understanding-money-transmitter-license-sponsorship-in-the-united-states\"\u003eUnderstanding Money Transmitter License Sponsorship in the United States\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the realm of \u003ca href=\"https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-services-business-msb/\"\u003emoney services business\u003c/a\u003e (\u003ca href=\"https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-services-business-msb/\"\u003eMSB\u003c/a\u003e) in the United States, obtaining a money transmitter license is crucial for entities engaged in transmitting or converting money.

Stat. ¬ß 53-208.42(13); ¬ß 53-208.46 NC Banks| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for individuals paying with crypto.\nOTC Trading (Business): Yes ‚Äì if buying/selling crypto for customers.\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes ‚Äì considered money transmission.\nCrypto Exchanges/Wallets: Yes ‚Äì typically must hold like-kind reserves for customer obligations.\nStablecoin Issuers: Possibly exempt if they‚Äôre only ‚Äúadministrators,‚Äù but typically require a license if also transmitting.| 2016: NC passed legislation explicitly referencing virtual currency, partly modeled on the Uniform Act. Exemptions exist for merchants accepting crypto. The state requires 1:1 cryptocurrency reserves for any obligations to customers, similar to Connecticut‚Äôs approach. NC remains considered a ‚Äúregulated but crypto-friendly‚Äù state.\nNorth Dakota| Yes ‚Äì North Dakota has no specific crypto exemption, so any entity transmitting funds (fiat or otherwise) for customers is subject to ND‚Äôs Money Transmitters Act. The state interprets this to include crypto-fiat activity.| Money Transmitter License| North Dakota Department of Financial Institutions| N.D. Cent. Code ¬ß 13-09-01 et seq. ND DFI| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for personal use.\nOTC Trading (Business): Yes ‚Äì if acting as an intermediary for fiat or custodial crypto.\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes ‚Äì ND treats them as money transmission.\nCrypto Exchanges/Wallets: Yes ‚Äì if handling fiat or customer funds.\nStablecoin Issuers: Yes ‚Äì no special exemption; stablecoin issuance is money transmission.| North Dakota quietly applies standard MSB law to crypto. The state is part of multi-state supervisory compacts, requiring large crypto exchanges to obtain ND licenses and undergo joint examinations. No dedicated crypto legislation has been passed, so the default framework remains.\nOhio| Yes ‚Äì Ohio‚Äôs Money Transmitter Act applies to businesses transmitting ‚Äúmoney,‚Äù which regulators interpret to include fiat aspects of crypto transactions. Crypto-only transfers (with no fiat handling) are generally not covered, but most major exchanges handle fiat and obtain an Ohio license.| Money Transmitter License| Ohio Division of Financial Institutions (Dept. of Commerce)| Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ¬ß 1315.01 et seq.Ohio DFI| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for private, one-off crypto trades.\nOTC Trading (Business): Yes‚Äîif handling or transmitting fiat for customers, a license is needed.\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes‚Äîtaking or dispensing cash in exchange for crypto is money transmission.\nCrypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Yes‚Äîany fiat on/off ramp or custodial service must license.\nStablecoin Issuers: Yes‚Äîissuing or redeeming stablecoins for fiat is regulated as money transmission.| 2018: Ohio briefly allowed tax payments in crypto (via a third-party), which ended in 2019 due to licensing concerns.\nOhio has enforced licensing for crypto firms through multi-state actions. Major exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, etc.) hold an Ohio MTL.\nOklahoma| Yes ‚Äì Oklahoma‚Äôs Money Transmitter Act requires a license for ‚Äúreceiving money or monetary value‚Äù for transmission. Although it does not explicitly mention crypto, regulators apply it to crypto-fiat transactions.| Money Transmitter License| Oklahoma State Banking Department| Okla. Stat. tit. 6, ¬ß 1512; tit. 6, ¬ß 2101 et seq. OK Banking Dept.| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for personal use.\nOTC Trading (Business): Yes‚Äîfacilitating fiat-to-crypto or crypto-to-fiat for others requires a license.\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes‚Äîtwo-way ATMs are deemed money transmission.\nCrypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Yes‚Äîcustodial or fiat-based exchanges must be licensed.\nStablecoin Issuers: Yes‚Äîno separate exemption, so stablecoins fall under money transmission.| Oklahoma has not adopted special crypto legislation but has quietly required crypto businesses to comply with MSB rules. The state is part of multi-state regulatory efforts; major exchanges have an OK license. No official carve-outs or exemptions for crypto, meaning standard money transmitter provisions apply.\nOregon| Yes ‚Äì Oregon‚Äôs Money Transmitters Act defines ‚Äúmoney‚Äù broadly enough to include digital representations of value. Regulators consider crypto-fiat businesses to be money transmitters, requiring a license.| Money Transmitter License| Oregon Division of Financial Regulation (DFR)| Or. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 717.200(9); ¬ß 717.205 Oregon DFR| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for purely private transactions.\nOTC Trading (Business): Yes‚Äîif handling fiat or customer funds for crypto trades.\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes‚Äîtwo-way ATMs are considered money transmitters under OR law.\nCrypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Yes‚Äîcustodial or fiat-based platforms must license.\nStablecoin Issuers: Yes‚Äîno exemption; issuing or redeeming stablecoins for fiat is money transmission.| 2019: Oregon clarified restrictions on state agencies and political donations in crypto but continued applying its MSB laws to crypto-fiat operations.Oregon participates in multi-state exams of major exchanges, requiring compliance with net worth, bonding, and permissible investment rules.\nPennsylvania| No ‚Äì In 2019, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities issued guidance stating that virtual currency is not ‚Äúmoney‚Äù under the PA Money Transmission Business Licensing Law. Therefore, businesses dealing only in crypto (exchanges, ATMs) do not need a state money transmitter license.| N/A (Crypto not regulated as ‚Äúmoney‚Äù)| Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (DoBS)| PA DoBS Guidance (Jan 2019) PA DoBS| Personal Buying/Selling: No license required.\nOTC Trading (Business): No license under PA law if it‚Äôs strictly crypto transactions.\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: No‚Äîexchanging cash for crypto via an ATM is considered a sale of goods (crypto), not money transmission, per 2019 guidance.\nCrypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Not regulated as money transmitters if dealing only in crypto.\nStablecoin Issuers: Also not covered, since stablecoins are not ‚Äúmoney‚Äù under PA law.| Jan 2019: PA DoBS interpretive memo concluded that ‚Äúvirtual currency‚Äù does not meet the definition of ‚Äúmoney‚Äù under the Money Transmission Business Licensing Law. This stance is among the most crypto-friendly. Pennsylvania enforces federal rules but does not require state MTL for crypto activities.\nRhode Island| Yes ‚Äì In 2020, Rhode Island revised its Money Transmitters Act to explicitly include virtual currency business. Businesses maintaining control of virtual currency (custody or exchange) on behalf of others must obtain a Currency Transmitter License.| Currency Transmitter License (includes crypto)| Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation (Banking Division)| R.I. Gen. Laws ¬ß 19-14-1(4)(ii); ¬ß 19-14-2 RI DBR| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for one‚Äôs personal use.\nOTC Trading (Business): Yes‚Äîfacilitating trades for customers is ‚Äúcurrency transmission.‚Äù\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes‚Äîoperating crypto ATMs in RI requires a currency transmitter license.\nCrypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Yes‚Äîcustodial or exchange services must license and maintain 1:1 reserves of each crypto type owed to customers.\nStablecoin Issuers: Yes‚Äîtreated as a form of virtual currency business, unless exempt.| 2020: Rhode Island adopted portions of the Uniform Virtual Currency Businesses Act, making ‚Äúcurrency transmission‚Äù law explicitly cover crypto. Licensees must maintain like-kind reserves (no fractional reserves) and follow cybersecurity and consumer protection rules. This made RI one of the more stringent states, similar to Connecticut, regarding 1:1 crypto reserves.\nSouth Carolina| Partial ‚Äì South Carolina‚Äôs Money Transmitters Act does not explicitly cover purely crypto transactions (the Attorney General‚Äôs office opined that virtual currency alone is not ‚Äúmoney‚Äù), but fiat-related transmission (e.g., holding or transferring USD for crypto trades) does require a state money transmitter license.| Money Transmitter License| South Carolina Attorney General (Money Services Division)| S.C. Code Ann. ¬ß 35-11-110(9); ¬ß 35-11-210 SC AG Guidance| Personal Buying/Selling: No license if it‚Äôs purely person-to-person crypto, no fiat involvement.\nOTC Trading (Business): If the business holds or transmits fiat for customers, it must be licensed.\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: If the ATM only dispenses the owner‚Äôs crypto for cash (no third-party custody), it might not need a license.

Until that takes effect, SC remains in a partial-regulation stance.\nSouth Dakota| Yes ‚Äì South Dakota treats virtual currency as ‚Äúmonetary value‚Äù for money transmission. Its Division of Banking has required exchanges, ATMs, and other crypto-fiat businesses to be licensed under the SD Money Transmitter laws.| Money Transmitter License| South Dakota Division of Banking| S.D. Codified Laws ¬ß 51A-17-1(6) SD Division of Banking| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for private use.\nOTC Trading (Business): Yes ‚Äì if handling fiat or customer funds for crypto trades.\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes ‚Äì two-way ATMs exchanging cash for crypto are considered money transmitters.\nCrypto Exchanges/Wallets: Yes ‚Äì custodial or fiat-based services require licensing.\nStablecoin Issuers: Yes ‚Äì stablecoin issuance/redemption is treated as transmitting monetary value.| 2019: SD‚Äôs Division of Banking published guidance that virtual currencies are ‚Äúmonetary value.‚Äù\n2023: South Dakota adopted parts of the Model Money Transmission Modernization Act, imposing 1:1 crypto reserve requirements on licensees. The state has consistently enforced MSB licensing for crypto-fiat business.\nTennessee| Yes ‚Äì Tennessee applies its Money Transmitter Act to the exchange or transmission of cryptocurrency when fiat is involved (receiving money for transmission). Purely crypto-to-crypto might not trigger licensure, but in practice, any business handling fiat for customers is required to get a TN money transmitter license.| Money Transmitter License| Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions| Tenn. Code Ann. ¬ß 45-7-205(6); ¬ß 45-7-207 TN DFI| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for private, non-custodial crypto trades.\nOTC Trading (Business): Yes ‚Äì if receiving or transmitting fiat on behalf of customers.\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes ‚Äì two-way ATMs taking cash to dispense crypto or vice versa are considered money transmitters.\nCrypto Exchanges/Wallets: Yes ‚Äì exchanges handling fiat must be licensed. Custodial wallet providers dealing with fiat also require a license.\nStablecoin Issuers: Yes ‚Äì if receiving USD for stablecoins, it‚Äôs money transmission.| 2018: TN recognized blockchain signatures/contracts but made no crypto-specific license. The state simply enforces existing MSB law. Ongoing: Tennessee is part of multi-state supervision; major exchanges carry TN MTL. The approach is standard: no special crypto carve-outs, but no added restrictions either.\nTexas| Yes (with nuances) ‚Äì Texas does not consider a direct sale of one‚Äôs own crypto to be ‚Äúmoney transmission.‚Äù But if a business holds fiat or facilitates transfers between third parties, it must obtain a money transmitter license. Texas also explicitly includes fiat-backed stablecoins as ‚Äúmoney‚Äù in its statutes.| Money Transmitter License| Texas Department of Banking| Tex. Fin. Code Ann. ¬ß 151.301(b)(3) TX DOB Guidance (Memo 1037)| Personal Buying/Selling: No license if selling from personal inventory (principal capacity), with no third-party funds.\nOTC Trading (Business): If acting as a broker/agent (holding customer funds or matching buyers/sellers), a license is needed.\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: If they merely sell the machine owner‚Äôs crypto, no license; if they transmit funds for third parties, license is required.\nCrypto Exchanges/Wallets: Generally must be licensed if they custody users‚Äô fiat or crypto.\nStablecoin Issuers: Yes ‚Äì stablecoins are ‚Äúmoney,‚Äù requiring licensing and full reserve requirements.| 2014: Texas was the first to publish official crypto guidance, distinguishing principal sales from money transmission.\n2019: Updated supervisory memo reaffirmed the stance.\n2023: Texas clarified stablecoins = ‚Äúmoney,‚Äù requiring licensing and introduced proof-of-reserves requirements (HB 1666). Texas remains relatively friendly for direct sellers but regulates custodial or third-party transactions strictly.\nUtah| Yes ‚Äì Utah has no crypto exemption; businesses transmitting fiat or acting as custodians for crypto-fiat trades must obtain a money transmitter license. Purely crypto-to-crypto transactions might not be covered if no fiat is involved, but in practice, most crypto platforms with fiat rails do get licensed.| Money Transmitter License| Utah Department of Financial Institutions| Utah Code Ann. ¬ß 7-25-102(9) Utah DFI| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for personal, crypto-only use.\nOTC Trading (Business): License required if handling fiat for customers.\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes ‚Äì if they accept or dispense cash, it‚Äôs money transmission.\nCrypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Yes ‚Äì exchanges handling fiat or holding user funds must be licensed.\nStablecoin Issuers: Yes ‚Äì receiving money for stablecoins is money transmission.| 2019: Utah created a fintech sandbox, offering limited regulatory relief but no permanent crypto exemption. Ongoing: Utah‚Äôs Money Transmitters Act remains broad, covering fiat transmissions. Crypto-only operations that never touch fiat might be outside scope, but most major exchanges have a UT license.\nVermont| Yes ‚Äì Vermont requires a money transmitter license for virtual currency businesses. In 2024, the state updated its law to fully adopt Model Money Transmission Act provisions on crypto, mandating licensees maintain 1:1 like-kind reserves and additional consumer protections.| Money Transmitter License| Vermont Department of Financial Regulation (DFR)| Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 8, ¬ß 2500 et seq.

Now among the stricter states for crypto oversight.\nVirginia| No (for virtual currency itself)** ‚Äì Virginia‚Äôs Money Transmitter Act covers fiat transmissions only.

Code Ann. ¬ß 6.2-1900 et seq. Virginia SCC| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for personal use.\nOTC Trading (Business): If you hold or transmit fiat on behalf of customers, you need a VA license. The license explicitly does not cover the crypto portion.\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Possibly not required if purely selling the operator‚Äôs crypto. Many operators do license to handle any fiat aspect.\nCrypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Large exchanges typically hold a VA money transmitter license for the fiat side, but VA disclaimers say it ‚Äúdoes not cover virtual currency.‚Äù\nStablecoin Issuers: Unclear ‚Äì the fiat portion is subject to licensure, but the ‚Äúvirtual currency‚Äù aspect is not regulated by VA law.| 2019‚Äì2020: Exchanges like CEX.io, Coinbase, etc., obtained a VA license. They must display disclaimers that it does not cover crypto transmissions. Virginia has not updated its statutes to explicitly address crypto. So, it requires licensing for fiat transmissions but does not regulate the crypto side.\nWashington| Yes ‚Äì Washington amended its Uniform Money Services Act in 2017 to explicitly include virtual currency as ‚Äúmoney transmission.‚Äù It is known for strict requirements, such as annual third-party audits, high net-worth standards, and like-kind reserves.| Money Transmitter License| Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI)| Rev. Code Wash. (RCW) ¬ß 19.230.010(18); ¬ß 19.230.020 WA DFI| Personal Buying/Selling: No license if purely private.\nOTC Trading (Business): Yes ‚Äì any business facilitating crypto trades with fiat or acting as custodian must license.\nBitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes ‚Äì WA is strict; many ATM operators initially left when the 2017 amendment passed.\nCrypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Yes ‚Äì WA demands audits, net worth compliance, and 1:1 reserve in the same crypto.\nStablecoin Issuers: Yes ‚Äì stablecoins are subject to money transmission licensing and must maintain permissible investments.| 2017: WA passed SB 5031, specifically adding ‚Äúvirtual currency‚Äù to money transmission. Some crypto firms left WA due to rigorous compliance (similar to NY). Since\n2018: WA has been active in multi-state enforcement, requiring annual audits and consumer disclosures. It remains one of the toughest states for crypto compliance, second only to New York in regulatory strictness.\nWest Virginia| Yes ‚Äì West Virginia‚Äôs Money Transmitters Act includes broad definitions covering crypto-fiat exchanges, ATM operations, etc. WV has taken enforcement action against unlicensed Bitcoin ATM operators in coordination with federal agencies.| Money Transmitter License| West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions| W. Va. Code R. ¬ß 106-7-2; W. Va.

The state also tested blockchain-based voting for overseas military but kept a firm stance on requiring MSB licensing for crypto-fiat businesses. No crypto-specific carve-outs exist, so standard money transmitter law applies.\nWisconsin| Yes ‚Äì In 2018, Wisconsin enacted a new Money Transmitter Act (replacing older laws). Though it doesn‚Äôt specifically name crypto, regulators apply it to crypto-fiat transmission.| Money Transmitter License| Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (DFI)| Wis.

Wisconsin is part of multi-state supervision, requiring major exchanges to comply with MSB rules.\nWyoming| No ‚Äì Wyoming exempts ‚Äúvirtual currency‚Äù from its Money Transmitter Act. Under 2018 legislation, crypto exchanges and businesses solely dealing with virtual currency do not need a state money transmitter license. However, Wyoming also offers Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) charters for crypto banks.| N/A (Crypto-only businesses exempt)| Wyoming Division of Banking| Wyo. Stat.

This attracted exchanges to re-enter WY.\n2019‚Äì2021: WY introduced the SPDI bank framework (Kraken Bank, Custodia) for digital assets. Wyoming has the nation‚Äôs most crypto-friendly statutory environment at the state level.\nCryptocurrency Laws: Washington D.C. and U.S. Territories Jurisdiction License Requirement License Name Regulator Legal Code / References Applicability Historical Trends Washington D.C.

A point often overlooked by those venturing into the cross-border money transfer business is that even though they may have managed to secure license coverage in the origination country, they still need to have the same true for the beneficiary country.\nMore importantly, the two entities must have a correspondent tie-up agreement in place.\nWhen you are being provided sponsorship by a bank \u0026amp;/or a licensed financial institution (LFI), it is important you understand how correspondent relationships work.\nBanks \u0026amp; LFIs cannot just unilaterally send money to another country. This is especially true when dealing with a repetitive business like remittances. In many countries, the payout country‚Äôs regulator would require the bank \u0026amp;/or the LFI be pre-approved and registered before they can offer such services in their country.\nIn many circumstances, a bank or LFI may already have an established relationship with a counterparty in the payout country or an aggregator/payment-network that can service the payout country. If these payout partners are acceptable to you, then there is usually no issue. It is business as usual.\nIn some cases you can come and say that the payout partner is not your preferred choice, the rates may not be good, or you might consider them to be competition, in which case, two things can happen:\nThe bank / LFI can look for another partner in the interim period. The bank / LFI can start the necessary paperwork to start the correspondent tie-up relationship with a new partner that you want them to work with. This can take anywhere from 4-5 weeks up to 6-9 months. It all depends on the complexity. In the interim period, it will be up to you if you still want to work with the same provider or if you wish to wait till such time that the bank \u0026amp;/or LFI has established the correspondent tie-up relationship.\nExpecting the bank or LFI to work with a non-licensed company or someone unilaterally assigned is simply out of the equation. The originating entity will most likely have a mandatory requirement from their financial regulator to conduct enhanced due diligence (EDD) on the correspondent and only then sign-up a correspondent tie-up agreement with the licensed entity.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/correspondent-tie-up-agreements/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"why-is-it-necessary-to-have-a-correspondent-tie-up-agreement-with-a-licensed-entity\"\u003eWhy Is It Necessary to Have a Correspondent Tie-up Agreement with a Licensed Entity?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA point often overlooked by those venturing into the cross-border \u003ca href=\"https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/money-transfer-and-remittances/how-to-start-a-money-transfer-business/\"\u003emoney transfer business\u003c/a\u003e is that even though they may have managed to secure license coverage in the origination country, they \u003cem\u003estill\u003c/em\u003e need to have the same true for the beneficiary country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore importantly, the two entities \u003cstrong\u003emust\u003c/strong\u003e have a correspondent \u003cem\u003etie-up\u003c/em\u003e agreement in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you are being provided sponsorship by a bank \u0026amp;/or a licensed financial institution (LFI), it is important you understand how correspondent relationships work.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Correspondent Tie-up Agreements"},{"content":"USA Money Transfer Market The US Money Transfer Market is one of the largest in the world, and perhaps equally coveted. In 2014, the United States sent US$ 130+ Billion worth of remittances to over 100+ countries. Gaining access to this market is one of the biggest challenges faced by Money Transfer Operators.\nHow Do We Get Started with Money Transmitter Licenses? If you are interested in having some form of money transmitter license coverage, you might consider reading the following:\nCorrespondent VS Agent (Authorized Delegate) FAQs on ISO/Correspondent Relationship Own Money Transmitter Licenses vs Authorized Delegate World over regulators are squeezing money transfer companies to restrict their operational geographies. The US is no exception. As per FinCEN\u0026rsquo;s (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) ruling FIN-2012-A001 which requires MTOs/MSBs outside the US to register with FinCEN. The core of the ruling is as under:\nOn July 21, 2011, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published in the Federal Register a final rule on definitions and other regulations relating to money services businesses (Final Rule).1 The Final Rule amended the definition of \u0026ldquo;money services business\u0026rdquo; at 31 CFR 1010.100(ff). An entity may now qualify as a money services business (MSB) under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regulations based on its activities within the United States, even if none of its agents, agencies, branches or offices are physically located in the United States. The Final Rule arose in part from the recognition that the Internet and other technological advances make it increasingly possible for persons to offer MSB services in the United States from foreign locations.2 FinCEN seeks to ensure that the BSA rules apply to all persons engaging in covered activities within the United States, regardless of the person\u0026rsquo;s physical location.\nSource of FinCEN Ruling.\nMerely registering with FinCEN does not absolve a foreign-based MSB / MTO from work with a licensed money transmitter in the US, which is a mandatory requirement for most of the US Financial Regulators. In addition to the registration¬†requirement on the US side, the local¬†regulator, most likely your central bank (see here for a full list of Central Banks around the World) in your country might also place restrictions on how you may operate internationally.\nMoney Transmitter License Rental Many money service businesses \u0026amp; money transfer operators are ill-advised as to how to proceed forward in their pursuit to get legal coverage under a license. First and foremost, stop referring to¬†renting a license.\nLicenses are¬†never rented out.\nNever!\nEver!\nSo even asking discreetly \u0026ldquo;Can you find me someone who is willing to rent their money transmitter license? \u0026quot; is highly frowned upon.\nThe diagram below depicts what in my view represents the best way to get started.\nStart as an ISO (Independent Sales Organization) / Correspondent Agreement Work towards becoming an Authorized Delegate Start applying for your own licenses and then Once you have acquired them all, let go of the authorized delegate relationship.

In this memorandum, we provide an overview of that process and what you can expect along the way.\nThere are two basic ways you can go about obtaining a money transmitter license\nYou can either handle the entire application process yourself, (with help from us), or You can also have us take a lead and help you with the complete task of filing and managing the application on your behalf. Before starting the process of obtaining a money transmitter license, it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand which states require one. This will help you focus your efforts and save time and money.\nOur company can help you with this process by reviewing your business model and determining which states require a license. We\u0026rsquo;ll also provide guidance on the specific transactions and assets that will need to be considered when applying for licenses in those states. This will help you avoid any costly surprises and save time and money along the way.\nAfter you\u0026rsquo;ve determined which states require an MTL, the next step is to begin the application process. This will involve completing and submitting several forms to each state\u0026rsquo;s financial regulator. The forms can be complex, and it\u0026rsquo;s important that they\u0026rsquo;re completed accurately and in a timely manner.\nWhen it comes to obtaining a money transmitter license, there are many things businesses need to consider in advance. One of the most important issues is what entity will actually file for and hold the licenses. Will this be done directly by the company, or will a subsidiary or other separate entity be established for this purpose? Many companies opt to create a subsidiary or separate entity to hold and manage the licenses. This often reduces the number of people who will be subject to scrutiny and review and also speeds up the process.\nThe process of setting up a subsidiary can be complex, but it\u0026rsquo;s a great way for a company to expand its reach. Here are some tips on how to do it:\nMake sure the subsidiary is fully capitalized. This means that it has the financial resources to operate independently. Clearly disclose the subsidiary in marketing and paperwork. This will help avoid any confusion later on. Make sure the subsidiary has experienced and knowledgeable staff. This will help it run smoothly and effectively. Have a services agreement in place between the company and the subsidiary. This will ensure that both parties know their roles and responsibilities. Decide in advance who will own and control the subsidiary. This is important in order to avoid any future disputes. Choose individuals with strong personal, educational, and financial backgrounds to serve on the Board and as chief officers. These people will be under close scrutiny, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to choose wisely. Once we know which entity will apply for the licenses, and who the ‚Äúcontrol persons‚Äù subject to scrutiny will be, you will need to:\nCompile a list of priority states based on where you do business. Provide contact details for the person at your company who will be responsible for providing documents, organizing payments, and answering questions from the licensing authority. Compile the required data and documents for the application filing process. We would recommend that this be the person who will take over day-to-day maintenance of the licenses, once they are issued.\nIt is important to note that in California, you will need to request a meeting with regulators and provide certain documents in advance before your application will be accepted.\nPhase 1: Qualifying to do business. To operate a money transmitter business (MTB), you must be qualified to do so in each state in which you plan to conduct business. The Company may have already completed this process, but we would need to confirm this before submitting the MTL application. In order to establish a separate entity that will conduct MTB operations, the entity will need to get \u0026ldquo;qualified.\u0026rdquo; Corporation service companies that handle filings and renewals can serve as your Registered Agent in the states, and our paralegal services will assist you in doing these filings.\nPhase 2: Preparing the applications. When applying for a money transmitter license, businesses need to submit a lot of information. This includes both safety and soundness checks of the proposed business, as well as character and fitness investigations of key personnel. Gathering all this information can often take longer than it seems at first. In our experience, it usually takes several months for applicants to gather all the required information and to get all the key personnel to supply the information for the character and fitness investigations.\nThe company may need to provide the following documents depending on the state\u0026rsquo;s requirements.\nInformation about the company and its executives‚Äô character, fitness, and experience. Personal information, including fingerprints for officers, directors, and certain direct or indirect owners. Disclosure statements. Money transmitter licenses are handled primarily through the Nationwide Multi-state Licensing System and Registry (NMLS). In order to apply for a money transmitter license, businesses must input some very personal financial data. Some clients feel more comfortable and find it more efficient to input that information themselves from their own offices, rather than having us do it. If you\u0026rsquo;re more comfortable inputting the data yourself, we can assist you with how to use the NMLS system.\nBasic information about the product and services offered; A three or five-year business plan with financial projections; Corporate organizational chart; Evidence of registration with FinCEN as a Money Services Business; A description or a copy of the applicant‚Äôs anti-money laundering program; Copies of the applicant‚Äôs standard customer and client contracts; Qualifications to transact business/evidence of good standing; Surety bonds or alternative deposits; Fidelity / Errors \u0026amp; Omissions coverage; Audited and/or interim financials; and Agent/delegate information, if applicable. Next, we\u0026rsquo;ll provide the Company with an initial list of materials that we need to begin MTL applications. If the company wants, we can start by creating a complete matrix that lists all state requirements so they can go through the process of gathering data only once.\nThe second approach is for us to prepare the applications. We will take the information you provide and create finalized applications with attachments and a cover letter. The applications will be provided to you in your office for review and signature. If a notarization requirement is needed, we can have a notary come to your office to notarize the signatures. Once signed, we will make copies of the applications and submit them.\nBefore you can apply for a money transmitter license, your company needs to meet some financial requirements. This usually includes:\nApplication/licensing fees: usually costs around $2,000 but can go as high as $7,500. You have to pay this fee when you submit your application, and we will hold it in an escrow account until everything is approved. Net worth requirement: the amount varies based on how active your company is and how many branches or agents/delegates you have. But in most states, it\u0026rsquo;s between $250k and $500k. The surety bond: there is a required base amount but that may be increased depending on how active your company is or how many branches or agents/delegates you have. The cost for this bond could be as high as $5 million, but it\u0026rsquo;s usually capped at $1 million or less. Depending on your company\u0026rsquo;s credit rating, the annual costs to provide these bonds would likely range from 1% to 2% of the bond amount. Once you obtain an MTL, you will be required to pay an annual fee as well as incur some additional costs such as audit and reporting costs.\nTo ensure a smooth and efficient MTL filing process, follow these steps:\nThe first step is to have weekly meetings/calls with your team to track progress and make sure everyone is on the same page. This will help avoid any delays or confusion. You should also submit weekly status reports to track progress on all pending applications. This will help you stay organized and on top of things. Finally, it‚Äôs important to have access to a knowledgeable member of your staff who can help with the application process. They will be your day-to-day contact and can provide support with filling out the forms. Phase 3: Application consideration and timing. When applying for a money transmitter license, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to be aware of the different states\u0026rsquo; application processes. In general, most states take 1-6 months to issue a license, assuming there are no material issues. However, some states, like New York, can take significantly longer. Before you apply, be sure to check with the state\u0026rsquo;s licensing authority to learn about their specific requirements. You may also need to participate in a pre-application meeting with your senior management before applying.\nWhen you apply for your money transmitter license, it\u0026rsquo;s important to know that the process can vary significantly from state to state. That\u0026rsquo;s why we recommend prioritizing your applications based not only on where you do business but also on the estimated processing time. Apply for states that take longer to evaluate and process applications first, followed by 1-2 quick states just to obtain a few victories. Furthermore, about half of the states have partially streamlined their application procedure, so we recommend applying to one of those states as part of your initial application round. The common aspects for each member state will be reviewed and approved by one state in the coalition. You\u0026rsquo;ll then need to follow any remaining state-specific conditions.\nOverall, we expect to complete all applications in the first 4-8 months, with licenses acquired in 6-12 months as a result of our experience and expertise. States like New York are an exception, however, and will most likely take longer.\nEstimated Costs Money transmitter licensing can be a costly process, with costs ranging from $100,000 to $600,000. The cost of the licensing process depends on the approach you take: if you handle the application preparation yourself, with some guidance from us, the cost will be in the range of $100,000- $250,000. If you ask us to prepare the applications, it is likely to cost between $225,000 and $600,000.\nIn addition to the application fees, you may also need to pay for a compliance review by an experienced professional firm. The costs may increase if you ask us to analyze multiple transaction types for determining the type of license required or analyze multiple flows of funds. Based on your requirements, we can provide you with a scope of work outlining the services we will offer for your MTL filing process.\nStarting your MTL application process in one of the states where the process is more difficult is recommended. California, Texas, Florida, and New York all have more stringent application processes than most other states. Even so, it\u0026rsquo;s still worth starting there, because it will make the process easier for the remaining states.\nDepending on the state involved, the money transmitter license application costs vary. Our assessment of the difficulty of obtaining a license in each state puts the costs at various tiers. The full pricing can be seen in the table below (opens in a new browser tab).\nMoney Transmitter License Application \u0026amp; Associated Costs for Each State US Money Transmitter License Pricing Sheet\nNormal states: These include - Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, US Virgin Islands, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Difficult States: These include - Arizona, Arkansas, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Very Difficult States: These include - California, Texas, Florida, and New York (including the New York BitLicense) Money transmitter licenses can be costly, depending on the number of states in which you decide to apply. However, these estimates do not include the cost of preparing required documents such as a compliance manual, business plan, etc. which can add significant expense. If you\u0026rsquo;re not prepared, we can provide a separate quote for those costs. The final cost also depends on whether there is any follow-up work required after an application is submitted.\nWhen applying for a money transmitter license, there may be some additional costs involved depending on the state. These may include:\nCommunication with regulators (in general, we anticipate that 10-15 states will have follow-up questions about the application). Addition of extra criteria to the application by the state regulator that is not stated in the application. Settling/communicating with the state regarding a substantial dispute or disagreement with you about the completeness of your data. We hope this information is helpful, and please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss the next steps.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/applying-for-a-new-license/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction-to-the-us-money-transmitter-license-application-process\"\u003eIntroduction to the US Money Transmitter License Application Process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking to obtain a money transmitter license (MTL) in the United States, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to go through a process that can be both time-consuming and expensive.

You cannot. This has been made abundantly clear. Principal License holders do not rent out or lease their money transmitter licenses.\nSo if I Cannot Get a Money Transmitter License, How Can I Go Live? You could go live possibly with an ISO \u0026amp;/or Correspondent program with the principal license holder. A more expensive way to go live is to become an Authorized Delegate.\nWhat Is the Difference between an Iso and a Correspondent? The difference between the two can be subtle, but an important one. An ISO, for lack of a better word, is an affiliate (reseller). One has to be careful when using the word reseller here, as a principal license holder cannot allow others to resell their services without becoming an Authorized Delegate.\nSo What Exactly Does an Iso and a Correspondent Do? AnISO (Independent Sales Organization) basically drives traffic (potential customers) to the principal license holder\u0026rsquo;s website for sign-up and transactions. An ISO is guaranteed commission on every sale, as long as the client remains with the money transmitter license holder.\nA Correspondent is a licensed MTO/MSB that is outside the US and would like to contribute towards the marketing effort of driving traffic to the principal license holder\u0026rsquo;s website for sign-up and transactions. The correspondent is guaranteed to be the designated payout partner of choice for the license holder for a particular remittance corridor(s).\nIs an ISO and/or a Correspondent given wholesale rates? Yes. Absolutely.\nAn ISO/Correspondent can be provided with wholesales rates while the published (or rack) rates - that the consumers would see - can be jointly set by the License Holder and the ISO/Correspondent.\nThe difference between the published rates and the wholesale rate is the margin for the ISO/Correspondent.\nDoes a Correspondent Have to Be an Iso as Well? A Correspondent does not have to be an ISO as well. It would only be an ISO if it is somehow contributing funds to the License Holder, who will then utilize the funds themselves and market their product/service in the US (or elsewhere) to drive traffic (customer sign-ups).\nIf a correspondent decides to be an ISO, then what it is essentially committing itself to is, that it will aid in the marketing of the principal license holder\u0026rsquo;s websites (products and services) such that all traffic, sign-ups and transactions go through the principal license holder\u0026rsquo;s main website.\nAt NO point in an ISO / Correspondent relationship are either one of the parties allowed to promote their own branded pages and/or products/services. Only the principal licensee\u0026rsquo;s products and services may be promoted.\nWhy Would I Promote a License Holder‚Äôs Products and Services? Why Not Mine? The reason you are promoting the principal license holder\u0026rsquo;s products \u0026amp; services is because they own the license. Not you. If you want to promote your own products \u0026amp;/or services you would need to get your own licenses or become an Authorized Delegate, which is expensive. The most economical and sure shot method of validating your business is to become an affiliate and see how well you fair at bringing traffic and earning from it. You lose nothing in comparison to an Authorized Delegate.\nCan One Become an Iso without Becoming a Correspondent? Yes. Most certainly. An ISO is an affiliate marketer with wholesale rates. You can rely on your principal license holder\u0026rsquo;s arrangement with existing correspondents in various payout countries to ensure that you will have a cost-effective remittance pay-through for a particular remittance corridor. A correspondent means you are actually a licensed money transfer operator, operating in some defined territory.\nDoes the Iso Have to Be in the US or Can an Iso Be outside THE US? The ISO can be anywhere. Unlike the restriction on the Correspondent who has to be outside the US as a licensed Money Services Business / Money Transfer Operator or a Bank, the ISO has no such restrictions.\nWhat Are Some of the Things an Iso Can/Cannot Do? The ISO is just a marketing arm so to speak of the principal license holder. The ISO cannot have their own website where they sign-up people, or in any way mimic a website where they are signing up, or use iFrames to sign-up. They must clearly transport the potential user to the principal license holder\u0026rsquo;s website for signup.\nAs with any marketing arm, you are not directly selling anything. You are promoting the product \u0026amp;/or service. If it sells, you are guaranteed income (the different between the published rate and the wholesale rate).\nAs an ISO, you cannot have access to any confidential data of the user, the transaction or of the system itself. You cannot hold funds, receive funds, or be a funds intermediary on behalf of the user or the principal license holder.\nYou market, you create your own marketing persona and drive traffic.\nWhy Would I Want to Be an Iso? The reasons can vary, but I can summarize the answer with the following examples:\nYou are a person/company in the US. You would like to get into the remittance space. You have no money transmitter licenses. You have no knowledge of how money transmission works. You don\u0026rsquo;t have the software or solution in play/place. You might have a Correspondent payout partner with whom you want to work. You might NOT have a Correspondent payout partner. You have developed your own website or app for promoting remittances. You do not have a full-time compliance officer. You have limited capital. You know some kind of a diaspora in the US to whom you can market. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to gamble too much for your own wealth in an experiment that might or might not work. You want to take baby steps before you decide to run. You want to enter a short term contract. You don\u0026rsquo;t want your monthly spend to be too high. You\u0026rsquo;re good at selling. You have access to a large user base that might be interested in the remittance services you have to offer. You are interesting in working with the Principal License Holder and getting a wholesale rate for pricing and working on the margins. Can I Create Multiple Websites as an Iso to Drive Traffic to Principal License Holder‚Äôs Website? Yes, you can. Provided none of the restrictions about privacy, sign-up and the transaction are eased, you are free to accurately promote the product on the internet (online) and offline as much as you desire. You cannot, at any time, obfuscate the redirection or the principal license holder\u0026rsquo;s identity.\nWhat if I Would like to Have a Co-branded Website as an Iso? Can I Have a Co-branded Website by Myself? No. As an ISO you cannot have a co-branded website. The principal license holder can, however, have as many websites as they want, provided they have regulatory clearance from the State\u0026rsquo;s Financial Regulators.\nA principal license holder can offer you a semi-co-branded page on their website, provided, the sign-up, transaction and everything in-between is done on the principal license holder\u0026rsquo;s domain/page.\nHow Would a Semi Co-branded Website Work? The branding can vary depending on the principal license holder who agrees to work with you. You have two ways of marketing it:\nLet us take an example of an ISO that wants to promote remittances from the US to India.\n(a). The first case is you get a domain something like www.SendMoneyToIndia.com which is owned by you (the ISO). You market this domain in your community (online and offline).\nWhen a person is ready to make a remittance, they would be transported (redirected) to say www.MoneyTransferCompany.com/SendMoneyToIndia\nThe www.MoneyTransferCompany.com domain is owned by the principal license holder and it would/should very clearly be obvious from visiting this domain. Here, under a semi co-branded scheme, you will have the branding of the principal license holder in America AND the payout correspondent (MTO) in India who will tie-up directly with the MTO in the US.\nBecause of your ISO agreement, you would be guaranteed the income, as per the pricing you set in place.\n(b). The second option is to market, www.MoneyTransferCompany.com/SendMoneyToIndia directly.\nSame conditions / restrictions as above would apply.\nHow Will the Same Relationship Work if I Want to Be an Iso and a Correspondent? Another way of understanding a dual-relationship:\nThe way you would go ahead with this is as follows:\nWe would have to find you a licensed money transfer company (principal license holder) that is willing to work with you, and the corridor that you are interested in. You would then sign up as an ISO \u0026amp; as a Correspondent with them. The marketing rights would be jointly conducted with yourself and the license holder. The end decision on how you can/cannot market is determined by the principal license holder solely. You can buy your own domain name(s), as many as you want and market them and redirect traffic the subdomain name of the license holder. The condition on how marketing is done would be controlled by the marketing guidelines the principal license holder would provide to you. The principal license holder would provide you with a base price, you can add whatever you want on top of that and quote that to your correspondent bank/MTO. If you are already the correspondent, then that mark-up is also yours. Depending on how the deal is structured, the license holder can provide you with their standard correspondents or you are more than welcome to bring one in. If you bring one in, they will signup directly with the license holder as a correspondent payout agent. You will still be protected through your ISO agent. You would be required to complete the co-branding and setup and do trial/test transactions. If you try to disturb the status quo, chances are the principal license holder will seek approval or clarification from various State DFIs. So keeping it simple and trying not to be aggressive in working out the best bang for your buck will ensure you will have a system that is live, rather than a pipe-dream. Once everything is in place, and based on the guidelines for marketing (to which you have to adhere), you can go live. We Own/Run a Duly Licensed Calling Card Business Here in the United States, What Sort of Business Can I Do within the Remittance Space? You are in luck. If you run your own calling card business, you can easily use that to transfer the value from the calling card minutes to remittances. All whilst still being legal. You would still need to work with a licensed money transmitter. Having a calling card business is not a handicap but an advantage as you essentially leverage the power of your distribution network to extend the space.\nWe Hear There Are Companies Like Precash, Etc. That Rent Licenses? Is It True? PreCash does not rent license. They work with companies they believe will add value to their existing business (i.e. increase sales) and then partner up with them by making them an Authorized Delegate.\nHow Much Does Precash Charge? PreCash\u0026rsquo;s prices are, needless to say, negotiable. They don\u0026rsquo;t just provide pricing to anyone, lest they be tagged by the state regulators as renting their licenses.\nThe supposed pricing is as follows:\nMoney Transmission Processing Pricing\n0-100,000, each transaction will be 25 cents\n100,001-200,000, each transaction will be 20 cents\n200,001 \u0026amp; above, each transaction will be 15 cents.\nSo their minimum revenue guarantee that they would like is $15,000 monthly. This equates to about 60,000 transactions per month.\nOne time implementation fee varies, between US$ 50,000 to US$ 25,000 - more so on the 25k side.\nThey expect you to sign a tight 3 year contract.\nWhy Should I Opt for an Iso / Correspondent Relationship When I Can Just Go to the Likes of Precash? No one is stopping you. As explained on how I perceive a company should start out with here, you can opt for the solution you feel best works for you. PreCash is a great company to work with. Just expensive. As of March 2015, they are not really onboarding any new Authorized Delegates per se.\nWhat Are the Commercials of Such a Relationship? Let Us Say We Are Interested, What Sort of Commercials Are We Looking At? Here are some realistic commercial figures you would be expected to pay as an ISO \u0026amp;/or Correspondent:\nThe Monthly Minimum Guaranteed Revenue Is Proposed as Follows: Enterprise Level MTOs (multi-country): US$ 5,000/month Large: US$ 2,,500/month Medium MTOs: US$ 1,500/month Small MTOs: US$ 750/month Ancillary Charges (as per actuals) KYC: IDology AML (Identity Mind Global) ACH Wire-transfers Credit-Debit Transfers Chargeback Charges The definition of the different types of MTOs are as follows:\nEnterprise : Multi-Country Corridors in one go and processing capability of US$ 1 Billion or more (Ex: Vimplecom, Telenor, Vodaphone, Oxigen, etc.) Large : Single/Multi-Country Corridor Eg: Large Banks, Axis, BDO, etc. Medium : Thamel Remit Small : Startups in the Remittance space. Per Transaction Charges The proposed charges on a per transaction basis are:\n0.50% of the total value of the transaction $1.99 per transaction. Integration Fees outside the scope would be capped on US$ 2,500. One-time setup fees for small time players is capped at US$ 1,000.\nAs cited above, this is a real-life example, however it does not imply as finalized commercials.\nWhat Sort of Payment Methods Would Be Available to Users for Paying for Remittances? To start out with, eCheck (or Electronic ACH), is the preferred payment method of choice. Some license holders have additional payment instruments like POS/Barcode sales, Phone Calling Cards and some even offer Debit \u0026amp; Credit Card transactions.\nMost providers that I work with, do NOT offer Debit \u0026amp; Credit card processing to first time users. They would like them to build their business over the course of 6 months to 1 year before offering Debit/Credit card processing.\nWhat Sort of Aml/Kyc Is Required from the Correspondent? Because the principal license holder will only work with licensed MTOs and/or Banks, chances are you would already have a pretty thorough AML/KYC compliance program in play. If you do not, then this would raise some serious eyebrows and is a potential red-flag.\nAre You Able to Send Us an Old Sample (s) Of Kyc/ Aml Policies Say from Some of Your Old Work (No Confidential Information of Course) - So That Our Compliance Guys Know That We Are on the Right Track? No.\nAML/KYC documents are paid-for work. Each is unique to the company for which the work has been done.\nWhat are other requirements that the partner will want from us? What we are seeing with others is when you start off they send a list of requirements. If we are able to get such a list, or know the requirements that will be great for our confidence moving forward. You be legally licensed Have a solid AML/KYC program at your end Understand what it means to be an ISO Understand the branding restrictions/guidelines you will be required to follow Understand the flow of funds and funds settlement Other than this, there isn\u0026rsquo;t really much. It\u0026rsquo;s a straight forward process.\nBarring the unique circumstances that you are on some list or are a company or country with which they cannot do business, you should be good to go,\nWould We Be Able to Request Due Diligence Documents from the Principal License Holder? Absolutely. Due Diligence documentation packets would always be available from the Principal License Holder.\nOur Financial Regulator / Partner / Partner Bank / Administration in \u0026lt;Insert-Country-Of-Choice? Requires Us to Show Some Documentation; Since We Will Be Operating under the Licensed Holder, Are They Able to Provide These to Us after We Sign an Agreement? We Have Extracted the Following as Items (Questions) We Will Need from Them: (a) Copy of Regulator License (B) Aml and Kyc Policies (C) Etc. Of course. You would be provided with a Due Diligence packet, and vice versa, one would be expected of you.\nDoes the Principal License Holder Search Customer Surveillance Databases for Known Terrorist Names, Bad Debtors and Other Generally Undesirable Customers? If Yes, Indicate What Recognized Lists of Known Terrorists, Etc. Are Used e.g. Ofac, Etc) UN1267, Ofac List, Specific Country Sanction List Yes. There is no compromise on the AML/KYC aspects. Every Principal License Holder implements a very comprehensive AML/KYC compliance program. It is expected that Correspondents will meet and/or exceed the laid out guidelines. Likewise, the Principal License Holder will also be adhering to the same.\nWhy Is the ACH Fees So High? Getting ACH (Pull) is essentially underwriting, where a bank has to agree to work with a money transmitter company (license holder) for purposes of doing direct debit. Because of the prolonged risk associated with an ACH pull (180 days), ACH providers are reluctant to work with money transfer companies. Hence, the higher ACH fees.\nBesides the ACH and MT fees, are there any other fees that we are looking at? Transactional/ monthly or otherwise? All the charges are on the commercial section above. If nothing new or more is added, those are the only charges one is expected to pay. Nothing other than that. Bank charges for pushing money to your Nostro account would apply, but they would be nominal, depending on what type of a push you take. If it is a feeder, whatever the bank charges, is what you would be expected to pay.\nOur Understanding Is That Idology Process Happens One Time, and That the License Holder Already Has the Process in Place So We Will Link Up onto Their Infrastructure for Kyc. Is This Part of the Deal or Are We Paying Extra for This? If We Are, How Much? IDology checks are one-time indeed. It is part of the license holder‚Äôs infrastructure. The charges vary according to provider and are usually $1 per verification/registration.\nOur Team Have Been Researching and We Are Seeing Much Lower ACH Fees Out There. Are You in a Position to Get Us a Better ACH Rate Than $ 1.99? Could We Get a Better Rate in Terms of a Tiered Approach? For example:\n0 - 10,000 .25 cents\n100,001 - 200,000 .20 cents\n200,001 $ above .5 cents\nACH is indeed very low. You can traditionally get ACH services for 10-25 cents. But these are Push services. The minute you cite the following, you will be hard-pressed to find an ACH provider:\nYou are a money transfer company and have a money transmitter license. The ACH needs to be pulled from the User‚Äôs Account (not push) The ACH transaction is part of a international transfer / transaction. Do this exercise and then you will find, almost no one is willing to work with you.\nWhilst everyone wants to get a better rate, you have to really put yourselves in the license holder‚Äôs shoes. They take all the risk, they provide licenses which cost in excess of US$ 600,000 to maintain, they pay surety bonding in excess of US$ 10 Million per year, they are legally responsible for any or all bad transactions that go through you. They find an ACH under writer, they find, all the solution pieces and put them together. Above all, they are willing to work with you. Not to be blunt, but this is what it is.\nYou would be very hard-pressed to find better rates for someone to work with you. IF you do find someone to even work with you that is.\nCan We See a Draft of What We Will Be Signing Up as an Iso, It Will Give Us a Clear Picture. Mostly No.\nMy job here is intro. You get the intro, you are then responsible for negotiating an agreement and signing it. Unless you are on a blacklist somewhere, or unless you are trading with a country that is barred from the US perspective, the license holder will work with you. In the event you cannot work with the License holder because you don‚Äôt agree to price, etc. then that would be your own calling. I charge for an introduction and that is where my work starts and ends. I‚Äôve never had a case where a party that was introduced was not able to work.\nHow Do You (Faisal Khan) Work with Us? I provide an introduction, based on certain due diligence done on you, including background checks. Then I see which of the Principal License Holders are willing to work with you. If they are, I share your information with them. If they agree, then I arrange for a referral fee (to be paid up front by the ISO/Correspondent). Once funds are cleared, I make the introduction.\nHow Can We Trust You? You Are Asking for Money Up-Front, What if You Take Our Money and Do Not Deliver? My reputation is very important for me. I invite you to read the testimonials from people I have worked with. I have (literally) hundreds of people who can vouch for me. I offer solutions - on my terms. Though this may seem unfair or harsh to others, but it is what it is.\nHow Much Do You Charge? This I will let you know once I have had a talk with you, discussed your case, studied your requirements and looked at the overall complexity of finding a partner to work with.\nWhat Payment Method Do You Accept for Referral? I only accept international wire transfers into an account in my name.\nWe Wanted to Find Out, if We Get to an Agreement and We Want to Move Forward, How Do We Proceed? I don‚Äôt raise any agreements for intros. I invoice you. You pay the amount upfront, once the amount has been received in my bank I then do the introduction, and then I hand-hold you for the meet-up, arrange a conference call, and transition you over to the license holder and their partners.\nYou Mentioned Due Diligence That the License Holder Does on a Potential Iso - Is There Anything ‚ÄòSpecial‚Äô That We May Need to Know/ Prepare For? Nothing really. Due Diligence is just to ensure you are saying what you are saying, i.e. you are who you are, your licenses check out. There is some form of an org chart given, you have an AML/KYC manual, you have an AML program in place. Your bank provides a reference letter, etc.\nYou Mentioned the Reserve Amount. Is This Money Used for the Transactions, e.g. The License Holder Has the Money, That We Keep with Him but It Is the Same Money Used to Transact, so That at Any Point We Are Maintaining That Amount with Them? Or Is It Money That Just Sits with Them and We Still Have to Provide Money to Transact? Maybe Just Expound More on This ‚ÄòReserve‚Äô Concept.‚Äô The reserve amount is to cover any returns or chargebacks, etc. that your customers might initiate. This usually is negotiable. If in the first say 60 days you will be doing US$ 250,000 in transactions, your reserve amount may be US$ 5,000 or less, depending on how the experience and payments/payout are. It is nothing rigid, but just something to cover in case of a chargeback on the US side.\nOn the Aml Officer Required on Board, Does the Office Need Any Special Kind of Certification/ Education? We Currently Have Someone Designated for This on Our Team, but They Do Not Necessarily Have Specialized Training for This. A CAMS (Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist) certification helps. If you don‚Äôt have that, you WILL have to show some course you and your team have taken in understanding AML, etc. There are quite a few providers who provide an online course, you can take the test online and pass, all within a span of 1 day. But you will need to demonstrate that you and your team have been trained in some capacity in anti-money laundering.\nWhat Are the Exact Us States That the Agreement Will Cover. (I Will Get My Team to Keep Pursuing the Other Places That This Agreement Will Not Be Covering.) That depends which licensed money transmitter is willing to work with you. Some have all 50 States, some 1 State. Some 15 States. It all depends.\nTransaction Fees - Is That Negotiable? Changes with Volumes E.T.C. Possibly. You would need to discuss this with the Principal License Holder.\nCan We Pay You the Referral Fees after the Introduction Has Been Made and Agreement Has Been Signed. No. I don\u0026rsquo;t work that way.\nIs the Introduction Guaranteed to Provide a Successful Agreement with the Principal License Holder? Yes. Pretty much. As long as you understand the caveats of your limitations and also that you do no deviate from the information that was shared, the sign-up is pretty much guaranteed.\nWhat Happens When an Introduction Does Not Work Out? Will We Get Our Money Back? No. This is the risk you take. I introduce you to a bona fide license holder, who has seen exactly what you offer, and you are pretty confident on what they offer and what limitations are at play.\nWhat Are the Marketing Guidelines That You Talked About? Can You Cite an Example? Here is a sample guidelines pasted below:\nMarketing \u0026amp; Advertising Guidelines Purpose The purpose of this document is to set and parameterize the advertising and marketing guidelines for correspondents.\nLegally speaking, if you are a non-US entity, and do not hold authorized delegate status or do not hold money transmitter licenses you cannot market directly or solicit directly customers from the US.\nHowever, because you have a correspondent tie-up with a licensed money transmitter, the Principal License Holder (PLH) can market on your behalf.\nThis document will tell you some of the Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts of the business.\nApproval All marketing \u0026amp;/or sales efforts must be approved in writing prior to going live by the Principal License Holder.\nCobranding All marketing material should be co-branded so as to look 70% or more with the branding of the Principal License Holder. This means the predominant banding and logo usage, etc. should be that of the Principal License Holder.\nGoogle Adwords or Other Online Text Advertising All Google Adwords campaigns and/or other forms of online text advertising, would be run under a separate account by the Principal License Holder. Prior approval must be gained from the PLH before your ads would go live. You would not be allowed to run your own independent campaigns.\nThe campaign cost would be as-per-actuals, i.e. there is no markup and/or any other charges that are levied in the marketing.\nYou would be required to pre-fund an account with the PLH for your advertising campaign. There is no mandatory requirement for you to engage in Google Adwords or other online text advertising campaigns. This is purely optional.\nBanner Advertising As a correspondent, you can engage in banner advertising, which again must be approved by the PLH. If the ads are being serviced directly or via a lesser known advertising platform/network, then you may do so directly, however, you would agree to adhere to the advertising and sales guidelines at all times. If the campaign is being run of Google‚Äôs network, then again, the prefunding option would come into play.\nDirect Marketing You can direct market to clients, but it must be structured as such that it is either a referral (to the URL provided to you by the PHL) or to refer to a website that you own, which in turn does a redirect to the URL provided by PHL.\nUnsolicited / Cold-Calling You can run your own cold-calling campaign, provided you adhere to the Do-Not-Call list and maintain extensive (read: detailed) records of the numbers called, date/time of the call, agent name, etc. If you provide recording of the calls, they would be beneficial should a claim come up. Under no circumstances are you to by-pass the do-not-call list that is prevalent in the US or market to consumers who are either on the list or have explicitly told you not to call them.\nReferral Traffic You can engage in referral traffic, provided you at all point in time, make the user aware that they are being re-directed to PHL‚Äôs authorized website, and that you are not providing any sort of indicative advertising as such that the service is 100% yours. The name of PHL has to be mentioned.\nDomain Placement Depending on the PLH that would agree to work with you, the branding can vary, you have two ways of marketing it:\n(a). The first case is you get a domain something like www.SendMoneyToIndia.com this is owned by you. You market this domain in your community.\nWhen a person is ready to make a remittance, they would be transported (redirected) to say www.MoneyTransferCompany.com/SendMoneyToIndia\nThe www.MoneyTransferCompany.com domain is owned by the PLH that would be willing to work with you. Here, under a co-branded scheme, you will have the branding of the PLH in America AND the MTO in India who will tie-up directly with the PLH in the US.\n(b). The second option is to market, www.MoneyTransferCompany.com/SendMoneyToIndia directly.\nSame conditions as above apply.\nDomain Exclusivity \u0026amp;/or Vanity URLs The Principal License Holder has to maintain dominance of their domain name at all times. This is the only method by which you as a correspondent can have access to the US market.\nDepending on how the PLH has setup, the www.plh_domain.com/countrynames might not be available, and you would most likely have to settle with www.plh_domain.com/yourbrandname.\nIn some instances, the PLH may allow you to have a sub-domain policy, i.e. yourbrandname.plh_domain.com and the PLH may opt to keep the countryname.plh_domain.com to themselves.\nHow Long Does It Take to Sign an Agreement with the Principal License Holder? Between 2-3 weeks to sign. Between 1-6 weeks to go live, depending on the integration and readiness of both parties.\nWhat Other Restrictions Might Be Placed on Us if We Work as an Iso/Correspondent? The restrictions (if any) are defined and notified to you by the Principal License Holder. Not I.\nHow Does Online Money Remittance Work? Remittance solutions nowadays are most SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) models, that is self-hosted and turnkey. It a 100% online white-labeled remittance product (service) that is specifically marketed to banks for inward remittances into their countries. As an ISO/Correspondent, you do not have to invest in the complex software.\nThe white-labeled service allows ISOs to have an established mechanism to receive electronic payments via the Internet for purposes of inward remittances.\nSome highlighted features of the product are:\n100% White-labeled Currently being offered from US to any country Directly tied-in with an authorized/licensed Automated Clearing House (ACH) processor in the US All monetary transactions are routed and handled by the ACH Day 0 File acceptance, Day 1 debit to client accounts and Day 2 credit via electronic funds transfer into nostro account of the correspondent bank in New York If you do not have a correspondent bank in New York, we can assist you with finding the right bank to have your local NYC account.

If you are on this page, chances are you are unable to get a money transmitter license for your business. In the US, being licensed in all the states is quite a feat that has only been achieved by the biggest money transfer businesses. For startups and new money transmitters, getting licensed is a nightmare.\nIt is not enough to be registered with FinCEN, you must also apply for a license in each of the states where your business will operate. This means you have to pay the high cost of getting a license for each state if you want to work in the whole country. Aside from the high fees that you will be paying, you will also be spending considerable amounts of time in collecting and compiling all the required documents by each state regulator. It can often take up to 2 years before your business has a money transmitter license for all 50 states, Washington DC, and 3 US territories.\nIf you are a business or company that is based outside the US or has most of its principal money transfer business in another country, then you are in for a whole lot more scrutiny than everyone else. Be prepared to spend weeks, months, and even years in satisfying the regulator for each state that you deserve to be allowed to operate.\nAre You Caught in This Nightmare of Money Transmitter Licensing? Let‚Äôs Look at Your Options. You have many alternative options for getting access to licenses so you can work as a money transfer operator. For example:\nYou can partner with an established business who already has the money transmitter license you require You could try to get bank-led sponsorship wherein the bank handles your money under their charter Or we can help you get access to solution providers who will not only get you money transmitter licensing coverage but also provide you with your own branding Every Business Is Different - How Should You Get a Money Transmitter License?

It is important to note, most states will take bonding only from the list of approved surety bonding companies. Let us also highlight something that people don‚Äôt talk about: the surety bonding companies is a cartel. If you do too much shopping and turn it into a beauty contest, they will find out, discuss amongst themselves and then refuse to give you bonding. Even if you had a the cash and wanted to give the State(s) bonding in Cash - you cannot. Nearly all of them will force you to go back to these bonding companies.\nNon-traditional MSBs such as Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency, et. al will have to pay x2 -to- x4 the premium versus the traditional MSBs. These bonding companies are nothing short of vultures. Be very cognizant of that.\nEach state also has a minimum and maximum amount for the bonds. The maximum in most cases is US$ 2 Million (that‚Äôs the cap), the minimum varies from state to state. The amount applicable to you, is dependent on many factors, which the state examiner‚Äôs office will determine, based on your application.\nWhat is the financial condition (at present) of the applicant?\nWhat is your net worth?\nHow much business did the company do in the previous year (if at all)?\nWhat is the projected volume/value of the business for the upcoming year?\nTwo great resources and an article that can be recommended for getting a ballpark figure on how much will the money transmitter license cost be are:\nMoney Transmitter Licensing Cost\nBy Grimes Law PLLC\n50-STATE SURVEY: Money Transmitter Licensing Requirements (PDF Document)\nProvided by: Thomas Brown, Lecturer, UC Berkeley Law School and Partner, Paul Hastings LLP\nBitcoin Law: Money transmission on the state level in the US\nBy Marco Santori\nIn most cases you will discover it is not the cost per se that is an issue as most businesses who want to venture into the money transmission space will raise the adequate capital required to apply for money transmitter licenses. The issue is the time.\nApplying for licenses can take a considerable time-frame before you have all the necessary licenses. Small states come within the 3-6 months period. States like Florida, Massachusetts, Illinois, New Jersey, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, etc. can take between 6-9 months, and then there are the big three states: New York, California and Texas.

The following is the definition of a Money Services Business (MSB) as provided by FinCEN\n‚ÄúMoney Services Business - The term \u0026ldquo;money services business\u0026rdquo; includes any person doing business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized business concern, in one or more of the following capacities:\n(1) Currency dealer or exchanger.\n(2) Check casher.\n(3) Issuer of traveler\u0026rsquo;s checks, money orders or stored value.\n(4) Seller or redeemer of traveler\u0026rsquo;s checks, money orders or stored value.\n(5) Money transmitter.\n(6) U.S. Postal Service.\nAn activity threshold of greater than $1,000 per** person** per day in one or more transactions applies to the definitions of: currency dealer or exchanger; check casher; issuer of traveler\u0026rsquo;s checks, money orders or stored value; and seller or redeemer of travelers\u0026rsquo; checks, money orders or stored value. The threshold applies separately to each activity \u0026ndash; if the threshold is not met for the specific activity, the person engaged in that activity is not an MSB on the basis of that activity.\nNo activity threshold applies to the definition of money transmitter. Thus, a person who engages as a business in the transfer of funds is an MSB as a money transmitter, regardless of the amount of money transmission activity.\nNotwithstanding the previous discussion, the term \u0026ldquo;money services business\u0026rdquo; does not include:\nA bank, as that term is defined in 31 CFR 1010.100(d) (formerly 31 CFR 103.11(c)), or\nA person registered with, and regulated or examined by, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nFor the complete regulatory definition of \u0026ldquo;money services business\u0026rdquo;, see 31 CFR 1010.100(ff) (formerly 31 CFR 103.11(uu)).\nNote: Each money services business (MSB) is a** financial institution** . For the regulatory definition of \u0026ldquo;financial institution,\u0026rdquo; see 31 CFR 1010.100(t) (formerly 31 CFR 103.11(n)).‚Äù\nSource: FinCEN\nDefinition of a ‚ÄúPerson‚Äù within the MSB definition: The definition of a ‚ÄúPerson‚Äù within the definition of an MSB (as provided by FinCEN) is as follows:\n‚ÄúPerson - A \u0026ldquo;person\u0026rdquo; is an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a trust or estate, a joint stock company, an association, a syndicate, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization or group, an Indian Tribe (as that term is defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act), and all entities cognizable as legal personalities.\n31 CFR 1010.100(mm) (formerly 31 CFR 103.11 (z))‚Äù\nSource: FinCEN\nDefinition of a ‚ÄúFinancial Institution‚Äù within the MSB definition: The definition of a ‚ÄúFinancial Institution‚Äù within the definition of an MSB (as provided by FinCEN) is as follows:\n‚ÄúFinancial Institution - A \u0026ldquo;financial institution\u0026rdquo; includes any person doing business in one or more of the following capacities:\n(1) bank (except bank credit card systems);\n(2) broker or dealer in securities;\n(3) money services business;\n(4) telegraph company;\n(5) casino;\n(6) card club;\n(7) a person subject to supervision by any state or federal bank supervisory authority.\nFor the regulatory definition of \u0026ldquo;financial institution,\u0026rdquo; see 31 CFR 1010.100(t) (formerly 31 CFR 103.11(n)).‚Äù\nSource: FinCEN\nDefinition of a Money Transmitter The definitions of a money transmitter are doled out individually by each state‚Äôs financial regulator.\nFor example, for the State of Georgia, the definition of MSB is provided by their Department of Banking \u0026amp; Finance as follows:\n‚ÄúGenerally, a money transmitter is a person or business entity that is authorized/licensed to transmit money.\nAs used in Georgia law, \u0026lsquo;Money transmission,\u0026rsquo; \u0026rsquo;transmit money,\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;transmission of money\u0026rsquo; means engaging in the business of receiving money or monetary value for transmission or transmitting money or monetary value within the United States or to locations abroad by any and all means, including, but not limited to, an order, wire, facsimile, or electronic transfer. The term does not include closed-loop transactions.\nIf a person is receiving money for transmission on behalf of another person or persons, they will need to be licensed. If a person were sending money on their own behalf, they would not need to be licensed.\nMoney transmitters and sellers-issuers of payment instruments operating in Georgia should be licensed with the Department. There are certain entities, however, that are exempt from licensing requirements.\nThose Exempt from Licensing Requirements:\nA state or federally chartered bank, trust company, credit union, savings and loan association, or savings bank with deposits that are federally insured;\nAn authorized agent of a licensee;\nThe United States Postal Service;\nA state or federal governmental department, agency, authority, or instrumentality and its authorized agents;\nAny foreign bank that establishes a federal branch pursuant to the International Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 3102; or\nAn individual employed by a licensee or any person exempted from the licensing requirements of this article when acting within the scope of employment and under the supervision of the licensee or exempted person as an employee and not as an independent contractor.‚Äù\nSource: Department of Banking \u0026amp; Finance\nThe list of all the US Financial Regulators for all the US States and Territories is provided here, and you can then look up the definition of what constitutes as a money transmitter for which licensing is required.\nMoney Transmitter License Law for Foreign Entities Money transmitter license law also applies to entities that operate outside the US. Better known as Foreign-Located Money Services Businesses, the ruling cites the following:\n‚ÄúAn entity may now qualify as a money services business (MSB) under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regulations based on its activities within the United States, even if none of its agents, agencies, branches or offices are physically located in the United States. The Final Rule arose in part from the recognition that the Internet and other technological advances make it increasingly possible for persons to offer MSB services in the United States from foreign locations. FinCEN seeks to ensure that the BSA rules apply to all persons engaging in covered activities within the United States, regardless of the person\u0026rsquo;s physical location.‚Äù\nSource: Foreign Located Money Services Business\nMSB Registration One of the requirements of the money transmitter license law is to register with FinCEN. The registration is simply just that \u0026mdash; registration. It does not grant you a license to start operating. Many businesses who are classified as MSB falsely assume that just registering with FinCEN for all the states as an MSB means that a money transmitter license has been granted to them. This is not the case.\nMSB registration with FinCEN is a mandatory federal requirement. All MSBs have to register. The next step would be to apply for money transmitter licenses with the state-level financial regulators for all the states in which you plan to do business.\nThe FinCEN MSB Registration page can be found here. The legal obligation for each business that files for MSB registration is clearly explained on the page, specifically with what sort of periodic/non-periodic reporting needs to be filed.\nIf you would like us to evaluate your money transmitter license requirements and see how we can assist you in finding coverage for MTLs, please kindly fill in the application below.

Many applicants file for a money transmitter license for a single state using an attorney / law firm, and for the remainder of the applications, they file it themselves.\nOnce you have familiarized yourself with the money transmitter license requirements, you will observe that they are pretty much the same all across other States with a few differences here and there.\nThe most important aspect of getting a firm grasp on the money transmitter license requirements, is understanding the taxonomy and nomenclature used in the industry and by the financial regulators.\nThis is what a typical money transmitter license application would consist of (example taken from Department of Financial Service, New York).\nSubtitle for This Block\nTitle for This Block Text for This Block\nHere is another example from the State of Colorado, Department of Regulatory Affairs, Money Transmitter License Application.\nMost applications comes with instructions on how to go about filling them out. Most sections within the application are self explanatory, however, be cognizant, this is a legal document, so think ten times before committing it on paper. Under no circumstances should you lie \u0026amp;/or give false \u0026amp;/or incorrect information. You will be presenting this application under oath.\nWhen in doubt! - Have it checked out!\nEssential elements in the application, other than financial and background information are:\nBusiness Plan Compliance Program Flow of Funds Projected Income Background checks, financial statements, etc. are all qualifying elements.\nJust to discuss very briefly the above mentioned items:\nBusiness Plan The business plan is essentially what you are being provided the money transmitter license for. So say your business wants to be a stored-value (e-money) wallet provider, your business plan would be reflecting that, and the assumption and grant of a money transmitter license by the State would be made on the basis of the information and business functions contained in your money transmitter application, specifically the business plan.\nCompliance Program This is extremely critical. Every state examiner will sift through your compliance program with a fine tooth-comb. A robust compliance program not only addresses areas like Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CTF), but also areas like data retention, the ability to pull non-repudiated reports, elementary (read; granular) details on each transaction. A secure, robust and scalable Transaction Monitoring System (TMS), real-time and batch mode filters \u0026amp; flags. The ability to define complex mechanisms for monitoring and control recommendations local to your geography, country and worldwide recommendations like Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering) (FATF), also known by its French name, Groupe d\u0026rsquo;action financi√®re (GAFI). The compliance program also looks into data retention, rotation, preservation, forensics, control, access, etc. If further extends to human resources and how employees, customers, and partners are screened, trained, revised, reported, etc.\nFlow of Funds The state examiner‚Äôs office will pay special attention to how the flows of funds for your particular products \u0026amp;/or services play out. In the information gathering stage of money transmitter license requirements, many applicants pay little or no heed to the flow of funds. Don‚Äôt let this happen to you. An Entity/Time-Motion flow of funds is the best way of not only understanding your business but also being able to see graphically (and very quickly) how money moves and traverses over the various entities (hopefully BSA entities) and other organizations.\nProjected Income Though the bulk of your documentation that you have amassed for money transmitter license requirements will be describing in detail your company, its employees, the financials, the background checks, the compliance programs, etc. it does all come down to money! How much money you will make, who your customers will be, what is your pricing mechanism, etc.\nThough you may believe very strongly about your projected income, the state examiner will have a very strong say in how realistic, optimistic or full-of-holes your projected income plan is. Also based on this, the assignments for surety bonding, tax calculations, net worth, etc. would also be examined.\nPlay it safe, don‚Äôt go overboard or undersell yourself. Be realistic.\nA strong suggestion is to spend lots of time organizing yourself when collecting the money transmitter license requirements.

Applying for licenses first of all takes time. Assuming you have fulfilled all the requirements of obtaining a license, it can take anywhere from 3-6 months before the licenses for small States are showing up. States like Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Maryland, Pennsylvania, etc. take longer (between 6-9 months). The big three, California, Texas and New York, take considerably longer. Though everyone will cite 6-9 months, in reality expect a delay between 12-18 months. Some of the aspects of owning your own licenses are:\nMinimum Net Worth Surety Bonding Application Fees Audit Fees (various) Permissible investments Banking Limitations AML/KYC Compliance Program (including the requirement of having a dedicated AML Compliance Officer) Lawyer Filing Fees Internal Technology Team \u0026amp; Back-Office Support Subscriptions for various Databases for AML/KYC Etc. A great document that outlines the costs associated with just the licensing aspect, is 50 US States Licensing Requirements. Compare the pain points associated with obtaining your own licensing versus starting out as an Authorized Delegate, which is a much easier process.\nHow does one become an Authorize Delegate? First and foremost, you need to find an existing license holder who would be willing to work with you. We can certainly assist in that. To become an Authorized Delegate, you must understand and appreciate what it is required of you. The Principal License Holder needs to understand who you are, what you do, and where do you fit in the scheme of things with respect to the Principal License Holder\u0026rsquo;s business ventures.\nUnderstanding An Authorized Delegate Relationship. Before the Principal License Holder starts dialogue with a potential Authorized Delegate, we start, they would like you to know the axioms that would be critical for the Agent on-boarding process:\nThe Agent on-boards the client on behalf of the principal licensee, i.e.Principal License Holder. The monetary transaction flow has to be as such, so that all flow of funds (and bitcoins, if utilized) have to be through the principal licensee‚Äôs bank account and the Bitcoin Exchange (if applicable) The product \u0026amp;/or service that the Agent is marketing or extending out, has to tie-in to the core product \u0026amp;/or service of the principal licensee. It is point # 3 that is of most importance to the Principal License Holder, as this is what the regulators would be looking for, to establish that if your company (if and when it becomes an agent) is extending the core product/services of Principal License Holder .\nUnderstanding the Business of the Authorized Delegate The Principal License Holder will seek a lot of information prior to even talking with you. They essentially are screening out any non-fit or risky delegates. Be prepared to provide a lot many documents, sign NDAs, and provide confidential information like Audited Reports, Financials, Projections, etc. Some of the items requested by the Principal License Holder are:\nA short 1 page summary of your business plan Need to have a detailed flow of funds and flow of coins (if Bitcoins are being utilized). What‚Äôs your go to market date? This is perhaps the most important question? Is it in 60 days? 90 days? 6 months? 1 year? Do you have the adequate capital/funding to sustain an agreement engagement with Principal License Holder? Or is it something that you will be raising later on? 12-months of projected financials (revenue) States in which you want to do business in? A brief project plan (timelines) A clear understanding of the physical locations and/or virtual locations you may be requiring. Based on the information supplied, the Principal License Holder will take between 5-7 working days and revert back to you with any questions or clarifications. There is usually a back-and-forth, to modify the flows and hopefully the Principal License Holder will have a finalized version of the flows with the least amount of iterations.\nGo / No-Go! Once this is provided, the Principal License Holder revert back to the client within a week to 10 days, if they can work with you or not based on the information supplied.\nDue Diligence If the Principal License Holder does decide to work with you, then due diligence is the next step. They will provide you with Due Diligence documentation and would request you to fill it out and pass it back to them, where it is examined by their Compliance Officer. Depending on your readiness, the Due Diligence can take about 1-2 weeks to submit and then 1-2 weeks for the Principal License Holder to revert back with any questions, gaps to be filled, etc.\nPost Due Diligence Once you are cleared from due diligence, the following is provided to you‚Ä¶\nthe contract draft, and quote for services is provided to you along with the necessary information pertaining to regulatory onboarding, banking requirements, processing requisites, deposit requirements, risk and compliance parameters, AML/KYC manual, Audit information, Integration information Branding and advertising guidelines API information, etc. Implementation timelines. Any other prerequisites and/or information pertinent to your situation. In most cases, the Principal License Holder will not provide this information before the completion of the due diligence process, even if the clients wants to prep themselves up to save time or get everything ready in order. Once the potential Authorized Delegate agrees to the above (quote, contract, etc.) , and would like to proceed ahead (provided no red-flags from Compliance), then you would typically pay for as per the commercial timelines, test integration and confirm that the two entities can indeed talk the way you and we are visioning. Each Principal License Holder has their own method of going live and more detailed is shared, once the Go milestone has been passed.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/own-money-transmitter-licenses-vs-authorized-delegate/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePeople often ask, why they should not start by owning their own money transmitter licenses.

You need a $150k just to file for the basic fees for all the license applications. You‚Äôd need access to banking (a difficult task these days), read the following articles: World Bank Survey Confirms: De-Risking a Huge Issue. Strangulation by Regulation. Can‚Äôt find MSB Friendly Banks? Go ahead, scream. No one is listening. Banking De-Risking: The Domino Effect Is Now In Full Force. You‚Äôd need surety bonding which can cost you a pretty penny. The premium is anywhere from 2% to 4% depending on the type of business you‚Äôre in. Some states may require $500,000 worth of surety bonding, some US$ 2 Million. It all adds up. This is premium payable every year. You‚Äôd need to go through audits, which cost a lot of money. Many different types of audits too! A full-time compliance officer in many cases Attorney/legal fees. Software/Systems fees, etc. FOR MOST STARTUPS, THIS IS A NO-GO. The costs associated with a money transfer license are high. Most startups do not have the budget nor the patience to hold back on their program, till they get the licenses. Even after you file all your applications at once, a few licenses will trickle in, in about 4-6 months time. Bulk of them take between 6-12 months. For states like New York, Texas and California, it can take over 18 months before you are granted a license.\nSo screw it you say! I‚Äôll partner up with an existing license holder. Well, this was cool for for many years, until PreCash killed¬†it up for all. Texas in 2014 gave a ruling that essentially (read: Supervisory Memorandum ‚Äì 1038) that put an end to this ‚Äúrental‚Äù of licenses that everyone was pursuing. You can read the¬†memo here:\nSummed up, today if you want to be an Agent of an existing license holder, let‚Äôs call them Principal License Holder (PLH), the following three conditions apply:\nThe clients legally belong to the PLH and not you, the Agent. It‚Äôs their license hence their clients. If you‚Äôre okay with then, cool, onto the next point. All flow of funds must traverse through the PLH‚Äôs banks. If they, the PLH cannot account for the transaction flowing through their account, then it is not covered. So your money needs to flow through their bank account. You might be cool with this too. Last point and this is the most important point: The Agent must be in the¬†same line of business as the PLH. So if the Principal License Holder is in the business of Pizza making you can be in the business of pizza delivery, pizza topping, pizza cooking, etc. But it the PLH is in the business of Pizzas and you‚Äôre selling Stereos ‚Äì then this is clearly a different line of business and implies you‚Äôre renting a license. Today, you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find someone willing and able to provide you with an arrangement to be their agent.\nThe one or two companies that do advertise that they hold money transmitter licenses in the market, you had better do research on them. Just because they pop up on Google on top, doesn‚Äôt mean they are your best bet to work with. Personally, I‚Äôd shy away from them. One or two of them are stubborn as a mule.\nThey are short on licenses in the key states (NY, CA, TX ‚Äì you need all three, not one, not two, but all three!)\nAudit their work location and you will find out, they are holding on to paper licenses, but no staff.\nAudit their financial strength. If they resist or hesitate, walk away! This is a two way street, if they will do due diligence on to you, you are allowed to so the same.\nAnd in a case or two, some money transmitter license holders are just plain greedy or not flexible enough to do business with. I cannot stress this enough. Ask around who their¬†existing¬†clients Agents are (they should easily be able to tell you this), fund out if such Agents are happy with their relationship? If they had a chance to swap out, would they switch? etc. etc.\nDo your research well before you jump into bed in becoming an Agent of an existing license holder. Do also remember that Agent relationships can be terminated by the State Regulator and also in some states are subject to approval.\nEven if you¬†do¬†become an agent, your responsibilities will be a mile-high. You will also need access to banking, which is difficult to get.\nYou may also want to read up on:¬†US Money Transmitter License Options\nNow For The Good News‚Ä¶ There are banks, agents of banking institutions, and non-banking financial institution who will provide coverage to your idea. Think of it as a¬†financial institution sponsored¬†sponsored¬†licensing.\nIn order to understand this concept you have to understand the very basics of¬†why¬†you need to get licensed as a money transmitter in the first place.\nUsually the following (two or more) are applicable to your case:\nYou are neither the originator of the transaction nor the beneficiary, i.e. you did not start the transaction, nor did the transaction end in your account, it was merely transiting through you. You‚Äôre a financial intermediary (that‚Äôs the correct term when a transaction transits through you). You can/could charge a fees for providing such a facility. The money flows through your banking channel/system, meaning if you wanted to, you could take it and run away with it. Buy lots of booze and waste it on vacation, while the original transaction generators, people who entrusted you with their money, get screwed! This is why licensing is put into place! Because you get to touch other people‚Äôs money flowing through your system.\nNow what if you don‚Äôt get to touch other people‚Äôs money and it does not flow through your system ‚Äì but rather through the bank. Since you‚Äôre not touching the money, you‚Äôre not a money transmitter. there are are finer caveats to this statement, but for most fintech startups I have worked with, with little or no effort the flow-of-funds and the business model can be molded so that a bank will sponsor the program. Short story: You won‚Äôt need a money transfer license.\nOne of the caveats is that you, as a customer, must subscribe to a default bank product or service, for example the bank could be providing you with ACH services or merchant acquiring, etc. You have to be a customer of their core service, which pretty much any decent startup wanting banking services would be.\nWhat this means is as follows:\nThe bank/bank-agent handles the money part on your behalf, under their own license. You don‚Äôt get to touch the funds. Even if you wanted to, there is nothing to touch. You simply do not have access to the funds that your clients are entrusting to you (via your bank) There is an agreed flow of funds, which forms the basis of the contract with the bank and how the money will be dealt with. Every time a client is on-boarded by you (via your app, etc.) the account is actually opened with the bank. The bank gets to act what to do with the funds, based on your instructions and the pre-agreed flow of funds. The instructions are sent to the bank via an API. You can also send it via a fax, but that wouldn‚Äôt be very cool or practical. Hence the bank opens its API and you can interact with it. Such a relationship is usually based on a revenue, share (so is the Agent relationship when you become an agent of a licensed money transmitter business).\nThey are easy, you get to get access to banking.

It is necessary to have such a license in order to legally conduct business as a money transmitter in the country.\nThe following options are available for obtaining a money transmitter license\nIn order of difficult (from lowest to highest):\nAffiliate Correspondent Correspondent / ISO Authorized Delegate Licensed Banking Agent Affiliate As an affiliate, you don\u0026rsquo;t hold a license yourself but rather promote the products or services of a licensed company and earn a commission for each sale you generate. You don\u0026rsquo;t have any legal ownership over the clients you bring in and are not involved in handling their funds. These responsibilities lie with the licensed company, also known as the principal license holder. As an affiliate, you are only responsible for promoting the company\u0026rsquo;s offerings and bringing in new business.\nCorrespondent There are two types of correspondents in the field of money transfer services: foreign correspondents and local (domestic) correspondents.\nA foreign correspondent is a company or financial institution based outside of the US that wishes to do business with a principal license holder in the US. This is done through a correspondent agreement, which is a legal contract that outlines how the principal license holder can send transactions to the correspondent and how they will be settled. A foreign correspondent cannot solicit business from the US directly, but rather must receive it from the principal license holder.\nOn the other hand, a local correspondent is a licensed entity in the same country as the principal license holder that allows for the settlement of transactions between the two parties. Like a foreign correspondent, a local correspondent does not hold any licensure rights on the transaction, but rather is simply a party to a legal contract allowing the transaction to be settled.\nIn both cases, the principal license holder is the legal owner of the transaction, and neither party can solicit business in the other party\u0026rsquo;s territory. The flow of funds touches both parties and neither party can assign agents or sublet work to a third party without explicitly mentioning it in the correspondent agreement.\nCorrespondent / ISO A Correspondent Agreement combined with an ISO (Independent Sales Organization) Agreement is a way for a company to further sell and promote the products or services offered by a principal license holder. The Correspondent Agreement provides legal protection for the transaction, while the ISO Agreement allows the company to actively market the website or app of the principal license holder in order to drive more business. In this way, the ISO Agreement takes a proactive approach to the marketing and sales efforts of the principal license holder, rather than just passively waiting for transactions to come in.\nIn both cases, the ISO entity (which may be separate from the correspondent or the same entity) uses its sales and marketing resources to drive traffic to the website or app of the principal license holder. However, the transaction owner will always be the principal license holder and the flow of funds will always pass through the banks of the principal license holder, with the ISO unable to touch the funds or collect them. All sign-ups and other actions must be done through the website or app of the principal license holder, and direct solicitation via any third-party website or app is not allowed.\nAuthorized Delegate The Authorized Delegate or Agent program allows a company to act as an agent of a principal license holder, effectively obtaining money transmitter license coverage under the umbrella of the principal license holder. This program allows a company to have its own brand and onboard clients directly on behalf of the principal license holder.\nThere are three key aspects to the Authorized Delegate program:\nThe agent onboards clients on behalf of the principal license holder. The flow of funds and any bitcoins involved must pass through the bank account and bitcoin exchange of the principal license holder. The products or services offered by the agent must be closely related to those of the principal license holder. This is especially important to the principal license holder, as regulators will want to see that the agent is offering products or services that are closely tied to those of the principal license holder. Many existing license holders are being scrutinized on their Agent relationships, in light of PreCash (a money transmitter holder company) that was essentially accused by the Texas Regulator of essentially renting their licenses.\nThe Department of Banking (for Texas) released a supervisory memorandum (1038) on this particular issue:\nSource.\nAs a result of this memorandum, all money transmitters in the US had their agent contracts reassessed and where the regulator saw a strong possibility of license rental, the agent relationship was terminated.\nIn the payments industry, PreCash was the go-to company if one wanted money transmission coverage. As of early 2015, PreCash has exited all agent relationships which they deem would be ruled upon as being license rental, and the very last contracts that they have on file would cease Agent relationship by October 2015.\nI‚Äôve written a lot more about the Authorized Delegate Program which can be read here:\nOwn Money Transmitter Licenses vs Authorized Delegate Correspondent vs Agent (Authorized Delegate) Licensed A licensed approach needless to say is all about applying for your own money transmitter licenses. A complete list of all US State Regulators can be seen here.¬†In addition to this, you can also read more about obtaining your own license here:\nOwn Money Transmitter Licenses vs Authorized Delegate Complete page on licensing and access to US Money Transfer Market Banking Agent US banks, whether nationwide or state chartered, are exempt from the requirement to hold money transmitter licenses due to their banking charter. This means that they do not need to obtain a money transmitter license in each state in order to do business.\nBanks can also appoint Authorized Delegates or Agents, who are also exempt from the need to obtain money transmitter licenses in each state. As an agent of a bank, you can operate under the bank\u0026rsquo;s banking charter and are not required to obtain individual licenses in order to do business.\nYou can read in detail about this process (Banking Agent), which some casually refer to as the FBO (For Benefit Of) Account Relationship:¬†Money Transmitter License: US Remittance \u0026amp; Payments Solution.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/us-money-transmitter-license-options/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis article will explore the different ways you can obtain a money transmitter license in the US.

A Money Transmitter License (MTL) is a regulatory approval required in the United States for any business that engages in the transfer of money, currency exchange, or similar services. Without an MTL, operating a money transfer company or offering money transmission services is considered illegal.\nBecause money transmission falls under both federal and state oversight, businesses must comply with FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) rules under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) as well as the requirements of each individual state in which they operate.\nWhy a License is Important The money transmission industry is highly regulated to prevent money laundering, fraud, and terrorist financing. An MTL ensures that:\nYour business is recognized and compliant with state and federal laws. You can access banking relationships that are otherwise closed to unlicensed operators. Investors, partners, and customers see your business as trustworthy and credible. Failure to obtain the appropriate license can result in severe penalties, account closures, and criminal liability.\nFinCEN Definition of a Money Transmitter According to FinCEN:\n‚ÄúA money transmitter is a person that provides money transmission services.‚Äù\nThis broad definition means that if your business touches, holds, or moves money on behalf of customers‚Äîeven indirectly‚Äîyou may fall under the requirement for licensing.\nState-Level Licensing Unlike many countries with a single national regulator, the U.S. requires companies to obtain a separate MTL in each state where they operate. Popular licensing states include:\nNew York Money Transmitter License California Money Transmitter License Texas Money Transmitter License Washington State Money Transmitter License In total, 49 states (plus Washington, D.C.) require a license to legally transmit money.\nFAQs: Money Transmitter Licensing What qualifies as a money transmitter? Any business that helps customers send, receive, or transfer money‚Äîwhether through cash, bank transfer, prepaid cards, mobile wallets, or cryptocurrency‚Äîis considered a money transmitter under U.S. law.\nHow much does a Money Transmitter License cost? The cost varies by state and scope. A single license can cost $50,000‚Äì$200,000+ when factoring in application fees, surety bonds, compliance systems, and legal support. For nationwide coverage, businesses often spend $1‚Äì3 million over time.\nHow do I start a money transfer business? Starting requires:\nRegistering with FinCEN as a Money Services Business (MSB). Applying for state licenses in each target market. Meeting capital, bonding, and compliance officer requirements. Establishing strong banking relationships. Launching operations only once all approvals are secured. Is a money transmitter the same as a Money Services Business (MSB)? Yes and no. All money transmitters are considered MSBs, but not all MSBs are money transmitters. MSBs also include businesses like check cashers, prepaid card issuers, and currency exchangers.\nGet Expert Guidance Applying for and maintaining MTLs can be time-consuming and expensive, often taking 12‚Äì24 months for approvals.
