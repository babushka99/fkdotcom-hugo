<p><strong>The total amount payable under this arrangement is set at US$ 375,000.</strong></p>
<p>An initial payment of US$ 50,000 is due upon signing this contract. The remaining balance of US$ 325,000 will be evenly distributed over a period of 15 months. Within this timeframe, all applications will be diligently prepared and submitted, with the expectation of obtaining most of the required licenses. Any necessary clarifications or responses to queries raised by regulatory authorities or examiners will be promptly addressed and submitted.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that certain states, such as New York (NY), Texas (TX), and California (CA), may have longer processing times for license approval that could potentially extend beyond the initial 15-month period. In such cases, the client has the option to retain our services on a month-to-month basis specifically for one, two, or all three of these states at a rate of US$ 7,500 per month. This retainer agreement is subject to termination by the client with a 15-day notice.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware that this proposal does not encompass any bank account services.</strong>  While we can offer introductions to banks and assist in preparing the required documentation, these services should not be regarded as integral to this proposal. Gaining access to banking, in accordance with Money Services Business (MSB) guidelines, may incur additional expenses for your company, which will be determined and billed directly by the financial institution facilitating your banking access.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to us. We are deeply appreciative of the opportunity to serve you.</p>
