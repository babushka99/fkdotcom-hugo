<h3 id="us-remittance--payments-solutionthe-problem"><strong>US Remittance &amp; Payments Solution: The Problem</strong></h3>
<p>The US Remittance market is one of the largest in the world. 2014 figures show US (outgoing) remittances were <strong>US$ 130.851 Billion</strong> (Source: <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.TRF.PWKR.CD.DT">World Bank</a>)</p>
<p>An interactive view of Remittances around the World, especially the US can be seen here: <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/remittances">https://faisalkhan.com/remittances</a></p>
<p>Banks, Money Transfer Operators and Commercial Companies outside the US are not allowed to solicit clients from the US without being registered with <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/knowledge-hub/resources-and-references/financial-crimes-enforcement-network-fincen/">FinCEN</a> and having Money Transmitter Licenses for each state in which they do business.</p>

<p>In order to obtain Money Transmitter License coverage, there are two avenues of approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain your own individual money transmitter licenses</li>
<li>Become an Authorized Delegate of an existing money transmitter license holder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read further: <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/list-of-money-services-businesses-msb-license-regulators/">Own Money Transmitter License vs. Authorized Delegate</a></p>
<p>Obtaining your own money transmitter licenses is a very long and tedious process. It takes approximately 2 years to obtain them for all 50 US States + 3 territories (Guam, US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico).</p>
<p>Companies outside the US or having a majority of their principal business outside the US are subject to even more scrutiny when it comes to applying for MT licenses.</p>

<h3 id="us-remittance--payments-solutionthe-alternative"><strong>US Remittance &amp; Payments Solution: The Alternative</strong></h3>
<p>Unbeknownst to many, a viable alternative to Money Transmitter Licenses is getting an FBO (For Benefit Of) agent relationship / account from a licensed Nationwide chartered US Bank.</p>
<p>US State &amp; National Banks are exempt from obtaining money transmitter licenses for each State.</p>
<p>By having a relationship with a US Bank for an FBO account, you are essentially provided MTL coverage and can now solicit clients from the US, legally, under your own brand name / company name.</p>
<p>However, finding a bank to work with you is the hard part.</p>
<p><strong>To be 100% clear, what is being offered below is a relationship to an existing service provider that has an Agent Relationship with a Bank</strong>. With this, you can launch your own brand but you are tied to the payment service provider (who has the agent relationship with the bank).</p>
<p>Direct agent relationship is not being offered.</p>
<h3 id="us-remittance--payments-solutionthe-banking-issue"><strong>US Remittance &amp; Payments Solution: The Banking Issue</strong></h3>
<p>Because of Operation Choke Point it is extremely difficult to find banks to work with, if you are a money transmitter company.</p>
<p>Banks throughout the US and the world are de-risking themselves from the money transfer business.</p>
<p>You’d be hard pressed to find a bank willing to open an MSB account for you, let alone provide you FBO status.</p>
