<p><strong>How to Get a Money Transmitter License in MA</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Register with NMLS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>All MA money transmitter applications are processed online and you will have to create an account for your business before you proceed. Simply <a href="https://mortgage.nationwidelicensingsystem.org/slr/resources/Pages/GettingStartedStateMLO.aspx">go to the website</a> and follow instructions.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Follow the checklist</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Use the <a href="https://nationwidelicensingsystem.org/slr/PublishedStateDocuments/MA-Foreign-Transmittal-Agency-Company-New-App-Checklist.pdf">checklist</a> to gather and complete all the necessary documents that are required for the application.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Complete MU1 form and other documents</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Download and complete the Company Form<br>
(MU1). You can find <a href="https://mortgage.nationwidelicensingsystem.org/licensees/resources/LicenseeResources/Company%20(MU1)%20Form%20Filing%20Instructions.pdf">filing instructions</a> here.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Money transmitter license fee for MA</strong></li>

<p>1. License fee: $1,000 per license<br>
2. Investigation fee: $300 per license<br>
3. Credit report fee: $15 per control person(s)<br>
4. FBI criminal background check: $36.25 per owner(s) or control person(s)</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Surety bond for Mass. MTL application</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A <a href="https://mortgage.nationwidelicensingsystem.org/news/Documents/ESB%20Adoption%20Map%20and%20Table.pdf">surety bond</a> of $50,000 will need to be submitted electronically with your application.

After approval, you will need to submit an amount equal to twice the average weekly funds deposited with the licensee by Massachusetts consumers for remittance to foreign countries.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Submit your application</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure everything is complete before you hit submit. If your application is rejected because you forgot to attach an important document, you will have to go through the whole process again which includes the fees.</p>

</ol>
<p>You could get your approval for a money transmitter license in 4 months if you are lucky. The usual wait time is six to eight months.</p>
<p>The whole process for applying for a license can be quite daunting and complicated especially if you are a new business. Perhaps the most prohibitive part of licensing is the expense - it is simply money that a fledgling business cannot afford. This is why many new businesses choose to go the route of quietly offering services without getting a license.</p>
<p>Remember, this is illegal and you should <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/understanding-the-united-states-money-transmitter-licensing/unlicensed-money-transfer-what-to-do-next/">NEVER operate without a license</a>.
