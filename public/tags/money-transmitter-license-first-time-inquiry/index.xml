      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We offer two solutions that cater to different needs. As a licensing option in the United States, we have two choices- owning or leasing. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that many people are not aware of the leasing option, which involves getting sponsored for a license.</p>
<p><strong>PART A: Applying for Your Own Money Transfer License</strong>  </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in applying for your own money transfer license, we&rsquo;ve compiled essential information on the costs, requirements, and procedures involved. Please click on the links below to explore your options: </p>

<p><strong>PART B: Utilizing Remittance-as-a-Service (RaaS)</strong>  </p>
<p>Alternatively, you may consider using our Remittance-as-a-Service (RaaS) solution, which allows you to be sponsored for a license in the U.S. without going through the lengthy application process yourself. It is important to note it includes banking, payment processing, licensing, compliance, reporting, and transaction monitoring, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Please note: This is just one type of sponsorship we offer. We have many more. Please inquire within.</strong></p>
<p>Please note: RaaS solution offering is for Person-to-Person (P2P) transfers only. If you are seeking a B2C or B2B cross-border money transfer, then please contact us as we have a separate solution offering for that. </p>
<p>Also note, in its current form, RaaS does not support cryptocurrency. </p>
