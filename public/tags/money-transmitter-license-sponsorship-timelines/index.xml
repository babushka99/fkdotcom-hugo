<p><strong>Day 1:</strong> We begin by signing the Referral Agreement and initiating the EDD Collection process, corporate setup, pay-in, and pay-out flows, correspondent tie-up agreements, and client types.</p>
<p><strong>Day 21:</strong> After receiving sign-off from the client for the pre-introductory material, we introduce them to potential solution providers with approved information.</p>
<p><strong>Days 23-25:</strong> We conduct an introductory call with the solution provider while maintaining non-disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Day 30:</strong> We directly engage with the solution provider and work on multiple facets such as contract negotiations, commercial terms, enhanced due diligence, technology/API, and flow of funds and transaction set.</p>
<p><strong>Day 75:</strong> We sign the commercial terms after completing enhanced due diligence and agreeing on AML policies/compliance, sandbox access, and technology integration/build.</p>
<p>By now, the following activities would have been completed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced Due Diligence</li>
<li>Acceptance of Commercial Terms and Signing of Contract</li>
<li>Agreement on AML Policies/Compliance</li>
<li>Sandbox Access</li>
<li>Technology Integration and Build</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 100:</strong> All development build, integration, and testing are complete. We conduct a final walk-through/review with the solution provider before going live.</p>
<p><strong>Day 110:</strong> We go live and launch the project.</p>
<p>Please note that while we aim to follow this timeline, we understand that flexibility may be required, and the timeline may be subject to +/- three weeks. Our team is dedicated to ensuring a successful outcome for our clients, and we will work closely with you to accommodate any changes that may arise.</p>
