<p>Every money transmitter in Georgia MUST get a license by applying at the GA <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/knowledge-hub/resources-and-references/nmls-national-multistate-licensing-system/">NMLS</a> if they want to operate in the state legally.</p>
<p>The process of applying for a money transmitter license in GA can be daunting due to its often complicated procedure, cumbersome paperwork, and seemingly endless documentation. But there is no way around it, is there?</p>
<p>Actually, there is. You can get <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing-regulatory-coverage/us-money-transmitter-license/us-money-transmitter-license-options/">license coverage for your business</a> quite conveniently and in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>Remember, it is a crime to conduct any kind of money-moving activity without a license. In Georgia, any business or person who transmits money or monetary value is considered a money transmitter and therefore under a legal obligation to obtain a license.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pursuant to the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.) §§ 7-1-680(13) and 7-1-681, any person (individual, sole proprietorship, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust, or any other group of individuals, however organized) that engages in transmission of money is required to obtain a Georgia Money Transmitter License.</em></p></blockquote>

It includes detailed information about how to apply, the documents you will need, and other important factors. Make sure you read and understand everything on the site.</p>
<p>Another important website is the <a href="https://dbf.georgia.gov/money-transmitters">state regulator’s money transmission page</a> which will also give you a proper definition of who is and is not a money transmitter in GA.</p>
