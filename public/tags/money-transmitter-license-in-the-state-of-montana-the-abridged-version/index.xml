      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Montana is the only state in the US that does not have a specific money transmitter license. However, this does not mean that money transmitters do not need any licenses in Montana. In fact, the <a href="https://banking.mt.gov/">Montana Division of Banking and Financial Institutions (Division)</a> has stated that money transmitters may need to obtain other types of licenses in order to operate in the state, depending on the specific activities they are engaged in.</p>
<p>For example, a money transmitter that offers escrow services would need to obtain an escrow license. A money transmitter that offers consumer loans would need to obtain a consumer finance company license. And a money transmitter that offers retail sales financing would need to obtain a retail sales finance company license.</p>
<p>The Division has also stated that money transmitters may need to <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/learn/explainers/fincen-registration/">register</a> with the <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/learn/explainers/financial-crimes-enforcement-network-fincen/">Financial Crimes Enforcement Network</a> (<a href="https://faisalkhan.com/learn/explainers/financial-crimes-enforcement-network-fincen/">FinCEN</a>) as a <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/learn/explainers/money-services-business-msb/">money services business</a> (<a href="https://faisalkhan.com/learn/explainers/money-services-business-msb/">MSB</a>).</p>
<p>The official definition of a money transmitter in Montana is not defined in state law. However, the Division uses the FinCEN definition of an MSB, which is &ldquo;any person doing business in one or more of the following activities: exchanging currency; transferring funds; or issuing payment instruments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following are some examples of activities that would be considered money transmission in Montana:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selling or redeeming traveler&rsquo;s checks or money orders</li>
<li>Issuing or selling stored-value cards</li>
<li>Transmitting money through a wire transfer service</li>
<li>Exchanging virtual currency for fiat currency</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure whether your business activities require a license in Montana, you should consult with an attorney.</p>
<p><strong>How to operate in the state of Montana without a money transmitter license</strong></p>
<p>If you are a money transmitter and you do not need to obtain a specific license in Montana, you can still operate in the state by registering with FinCEN as an MSB.</p>
<p>To register with FinCEN, you must complete and submit a Form FinCEN-114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR). You can register online at the FinCEN website.</p>
<p>Once you are registered with FinCEN, you will need to file an annual report, Form FinCEN-114a, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Montana is unique in the United States for not requiring a specific money transmitter license. However, based on their activities, money transmitters in Montana might need to secure other forms of licensing. Additionally, they are required to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a Money Services Business (MSB). If you&rsquo;re uncertain about the licensing needs for your business in Montana, it&rsquo;s advisable to consult with an attorney.</p>
