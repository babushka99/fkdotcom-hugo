&lt;h2 id=&#34;faq-what-does-it-cost-to-launch-a-us-baas-based-banking--payment-platform-as-a-foreign-entity&#34;&gt;FAQ: What Does It Cost to Launch a U.S. BaaS-Based Banking &amp;amp; Payment Platform as a Foreign Entity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;q1-what-is-the-most-cost-effective-way-for-a-non-us-entrepreneur-to-access-us-banking-infrastructure&#34;&gt;Q1: What is the most cost-effective way for a non-U.S. entrepreneur to access U.S. banking infrastructure?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of applying for your own U.S. money transmitter licenses—which can cost between $1.7 million and $2.3 million for nationwide coverage—the more affordable and faster route is to partner with a licensed Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider. This allows you to offer U.S. bank accounts and related services to international clients, such as freelancers in Bangladesh, Nigeria, India, and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
