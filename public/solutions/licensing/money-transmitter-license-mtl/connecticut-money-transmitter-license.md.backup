# Connecticut Money Transmitter License Overview

## Do I Need a Money Transmitter License in Connecticut?

Money transmission activities are regulated in Connecticut and every [money transfer business](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/how-to-start-a-money-transfer-business/) operating in the state is required by law to obtain a license.

According to [Sec. 36a-597 of the Connecticut General Statute](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_668.htm#sec_36a-597), “No person shall engage in the business of money transmission in this state, or advertise or solicit such services, without a main office license issued by the commissioner as provided in sections 36a-595 to 36a-612, inclusive, except as an authorized delegate of a person that has been issued a license by the commissioner and in accordance with section 36a-607.”

As per the Connecticut General Statute, a person/company is engaged in money transfer business if the person/business:

  1. Has a place of business located in this state,
  2. receives money or monetary value in this state or from a person located in this state,
  3. transmits money or monetary value from a location in this state or to a person located in this state,
  4. issues stored value or payment instruments that are sold in this state, or
