## United States Money Services Businesses & Money Transmitter License

Welcome to our page on the United States Money Transmitter License (MTL) and [money services businesses](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-services-business-msb/)!

As a [money services business (MSB)](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-services-business-msb/), you are required to register with the [Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/resources-and-references/financial-crimes-enforcement-network-fincen/) and obtain a money transmitter license in the United States. This license allows you to legally transmit money or monetary instruments, such as checks, drafts, and wire transfers.

There are a few different options for obtaining a money transmitter license, depending on your specific circumstances. You can apply for a license directly with the state in which you plan to operate, or you can become an agent of an existing license holder. In some cases, it may also be possible to be sponsored for a license by an existing license holder, or to essentially "rent" a license by partnering with a license holder and conducting your money transmission activities under their license.

It is important to note that the requirements for a money transmitter license vary by state, so it is essential to research the specific requirements for the state in which you plan to operate. The application process may include completing a detailed application, providing information about your business and its owners, and passing a background check. You may also be required to post a surety bond or maintain a certain amount of capital as collateral.

As an MSB, you will also be subject to ongoing [regulatory requirements](https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/list-of-us-state-financial-regulators/), including the obligation to report suspicious activity and maintain thorough records of your transactions. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in significant fines and even criminal charges.
