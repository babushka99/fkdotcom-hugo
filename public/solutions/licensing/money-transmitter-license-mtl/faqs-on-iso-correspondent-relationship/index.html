<h3 id="how-can-i-rent-a-money-transmitter-license">How Can I Rent a Money Transmitter License?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-can-i-rent-a-money-transmitter-license">#</a></h3>
<p>You cannot. This has been made abundantly clear. Principal License holders do not rent out or lease their money transmitter licenses.</p>
<h3 id="so-if-i-cannot-get-a-money-transmitter-license-how-can-i-go-live">So if I Cannot Get a Money Transmitter License, How Can I Go Live?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#so-if-i-cannot-get-a-money-transmitter-license-how-can-i-go-live">#</a></h3>
<p>You <em>could</em> go live possibly with an <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/independent-sales-organization-iso/">ISO</a> &amp;/or <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/correspondent-tie-up-agreements/">Correspondent</a> program with the <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/knowledge-hub/resources-and-references/principal-license-holder-plh/">principal license holder</a>. A more expensive way to go live is to become an <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/correspondent-vs-agent-authorized-delegate/">Authorized Delegate</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-an-iso-and-a-correspondent">What Is the Difference between an Iso and a Correspondent?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-an-iso-and-a-correspondent">#</a></h3>
<p>The difference between the two can be subtle, but an important one. An ISO, for lack of a better word, is an affiliate (reseller). One has to be careful when using the word reseller here, as a principal license holder cannot allow others to resell their services without becoming an  <em>Authorized Delegate</em>.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-exactly-does-an-iso-and-a-correspondent-do">So What Exactly Does an Iso and a Correspondent Do?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#so-what-exactly-does-an-iso-and-a-correspondent-do">#</a></h3>
<p>An<strong>ISO (Independent Sales Organization)</strong> basically drives traffic (potential customers) to the principal license holder&rsquo;s website for sign-up and transactions. An ISO is guaranteed commission on every sale, as long as the client remains with the money transmitter license holder.</p>
<p>A <strong>Correspondent</strong> is a licensed MTO/MSB that is  <em>outside</em> the US and would like to contribute towards the marketing effort of driving traffic to the principal license holder&rsquo;s website for sign-up and transactions. The correspondent is guaranteed to be the designated payout partner of choice for the license holder for a particular remittance corridor(s).</p>
<h3 id="is-an-iso-andor-a-correspondent-given-wholesale-rates">Is an ISO and/or a Correspondent given wholesale rates?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#is-an-iso-andor-a-correspondent-given-wholesale-rates">#</a></h3>
<p>Yes. Absolutely.</p>
<p>An ISO/Correspondent can be provided with wholesales rates while the published (or rack) rates - that the consumers would see - can be jointly set by the License Holder and the ISO/Correspondent.</p>
<p>The difference between the published rates and the wholesale rate is the  <em>margin</em> for the ISO/Correspondent.</p>
<h3 id="does-a-correspondent-have-to-be-an-iso-as-well">Does a Correspondent Have to Be an Iso as Well?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#does-a-correspondent-have-to-be-an-iso-as-well">#</a></h3>
<p>A Correspondent does not have to be an ISO as well. It would only be an ISO if it is somehow contributing funds to the License Holder, who will then utilize the funds themselves and market their product/service in the US (or elsewhere) to drive traffic (customer sign-ups).</p>
<p><em>If</em> a correspondent decides to be an ISO, then what it is essentially committing itself to is, that it will  <em>aid</em> in the marketing of the principal license holder&rsquo;s websites (products and services) such that all traffic, sign-ups and transactions go through the principal license holder&rsquo;s main website.</p>
<p>At NO point in an ISO / Correspondent relationship are either one of the parties allowed to promote their own branded pages and/or products/services. Only the principal licensee&rsquo;s products and services may be promoted.</p>
<h3 id="why-would-i-promote-a-license-holders-products-and-services-why-not-mine">Why Would I Promote a License Holder’s Products and Services? Why Not Mine?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-would-i-promote-a-license-holders-products-and-services-why-not-mine">#</a></h3>
<p>The reason you are promoting the principal license holder&rsquo;s products &amp; services is because  <em>they</em> own the license. Not you. If you want to promote your own products &amp;/or services you would need to get your own licenses or become an Authorized Delegate, which is expensive. The most economical and sure shot method of validating your business is to become an affiliate and see how well you fair at bringing traffic and earning from it. You lose nothing in comparison to an Authorized Delegate.</p>
<h3 id="can-one-become-an-iso-without-becoming-a-correspondent">Can One Become an Iso without Becoming a Correspondent?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#can-one-become-an-iso-without-becoming-a-correspondent">#</a></h3>
<p>Yes. Most certainly. An ISO is an affiliate marketer with wholesale rates. You can rely on your principal license holder&rsquo;s arrangement with existing correspondents in various payout countries to ensure that you will have a cost-effective remittance pay-through for a particular remittance corridor. A correspondent means you are actually a licensed money transfer operator, operating in some defined territory.</p>
<h3 id="does-the-iso-have-to-be-in-the-us-or-can-an-iso-be-outside-the-us">Does the Iso Have to Be in the US or Can an Iso Be outside THE US?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#does-the-iso-have-to-be-in-the-us-or-can-an-iso-be-outside-the-us">#</a></h3>
<p>The ISO can be anywhere. Unlike the restriction on the Correspondent who  <em>has</em> to be outside the US as a licensed Money Services Business / Money Transfer Operator or a Bank, the ISO has no such restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-some-of-the-things-an-iso-cancannot-do">What Are Some of the Things an Iso Can/Cannot Do?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-are-some-of-the-things-an-iso-cancannot-do">#</a></h3>
<p>The ISO is just a marketing arm so to speak of the principal license holder. The ISO cannot have their own website where they sign-up people, or in any way mimic a website where they are signing up, or use iFrames to sign-up. They must clearly transport the potential user to the principal license holder&rsquo;s website for signup.</p>
<p>As with any marketing arm, you are not directly selling anything. You are  <em>promoting</em> the product &amp;/or service. If it sells, you are  <em>guaranteed</em> income (the different between the published rate and the wholesale rate).</p>
<p>As an ISO, you cannot have access to  <em>any</em> confidential data of the user, the transaction or of the system itself. You cannot hold funds, receive funds, or be a funds intermediary on behalf of the user or the principal license holder.</p>
<p>You market, you create your own marketing persona and drive traffic.</p>
<h3 id="why-would-i-want-to-be-an-iso">Why Would I Want to Be an Iso?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-would-i-want-to-be-an-iso">#</a></h3>
<p>The reasons can vary, but I can summarize the answer with the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are a person/company in the US.</li>
<li>You would like to get into the remittance space.</li>
<li>You have no money transmitter licenses.</li>
<li>You have no knowledge of how money transmission works.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t have the software or solution in play/place.</li>
<li>You  <em>might</em> have a Correspondent payout partner with whom you want to work.</li>
<li>You might NOT have a Correspondent payout partner.</li>
<li>You have developed your own website or app for promoting remittances.</li>
<li>You do not have a full-time compliance officer.</li>
<li>You have limited capital.</li>
<li>You know some kind of a diaspora in the US to whom you can market.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t want to gamble too much for your own wealth in an experiment that  <em>might</em> or  <em>might not</em> work.</li>
<li>You want to take baby steps before you decide to run.</li>
<li>You want to enter a short term contract.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t want your monthly spend to be too high.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re good at selling.</li>
<li>You have access to a large user base that might be interested in the remittance services you have to offer.</li>
<li>You are interesting in working with the Principal License Holder and getting a wholesale rate for pricing and working on the margins.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-i-create-multiple-websites-as-an-iso-to-drive-traffic-to-principal-license-holders-website">Can I Create Multiple Websites as an Iso to Drive Traffic to Principal License Holder’s Website?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#can-i-create-multiple-websites-as-an-iso-to-drive-traffic-to-principal-license-holders-website">#</a></h3>
<p>Yes, you can. Provided none of the restrictions about privacy, sign-up and the transaction are eased, you are free to <em>accurately</em>  <em>promote</em> the product on the internet (online) and offline as much as you desire. You cannot, at any time, obfuscate the redirection or the principal license holder&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-i-would-like-to-have-a-co-branded-website-as-an-iso-can-i-have-a-co-branded-website-by-myself">What if I Would like to Have a Co-branded Website as an Iso? Can I Have a Co-branded Website by Myself?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-if-i-would-like-to-have-a-co-branded-website-as-an-iso-can-i-have-a-co-branded-website-by-myself">#</a></h3>
<p>No. As an ISO you cannot have a co-branded website. The principal license holder  <em>can,</em> however, have as many websites as they want, provided they have regulatory clearance from the State&rsquo;s Financial Regulators.</p>
<p>A principal license holder  <em>can</em> offer you a semi-co-branded page on  <em>their</em> website, provided, the sign-up, transaction and everything in-between is done on the principal license holder&rsquo;s domain/page.</p>
<h3 id="how-would-a-semi-co-branded-website-work">How Would a Semi Co-branded Website Work?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-would-a-semi-co-branded-website-work">#</a></h3>
<p>The branding can vary depending on the principal license holder who agrees to work with you. You have two ways of marketing it:</p>
<p>Let us take an example of an ISO that wants to promote remittances from the US to India.</p>
<p>(a). The first case is you get a domain something like <em><a href="https://www.SendMoneyToIndia.com">www.SendMoneyToIndia.com</a></em> which is owned by you (the ISO). You market this domain in your community (online and offline).</p>
<p>When a person is ready to make a remittance, they would be transported (redirected) to say <em><a href="https://www.MoneyTransferCompany.com/SendMoneyToIndia">www.MoneyTransferCompany.com/SendMoneyToIndia</a></em></p>
<p>The <em><a href="https://www.MoneyTransferCompany.com">www.MoneyTransferCompany.com</a> domain</em> is owned by the principal license holder and it would/should very clearly be obvious from visiting this domain. Here, under a semi co-branded scheme, you will have the branding of the principal license holder in America AND the payout correspondent (MTO) in India who will tie-up directly with the MTO in the US.</p>
<p>Because of your ISO agreement, you would be guaranteed the income, as per the pricing you set in place.</p>
<p>(b). The second option is to market, <em><a href="https://www.MoneyTransferCompany.com/SendMoneyToIndia">www.MoneyTransferCompany.com/SendMoneyToIndia</a></em> directly.</p>
<p>Same conditions / restrictions as above would apply.</p>

<p>Another way of understanding a dual-relationship:</p>
<p>The way you would go ahead with this is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We would have to find you a licensed money transfer company (principal license holder) that is willing to work with you, and the corridor that you are interested in.</li>
<li>You would then sign up as an ISO &amp; as a Correspondent with them. The marketing rights would be jointly conducted with yourself and the license holder.</li>
<li>The end decision on how you can/cannot market is determined by the principal license holder solely.</li>
<li>You can buy your own domain name(s), as many as you want and market them and redirect traffic the subdomain name of the license holder. The condition on how marketing is done would be controlled by the marketing guidelines the principal license holder would provide to you.</li>
<li>The principal license holder would provide you with a base price, you can add whatever you want on top of that and quote that to your correspondent bank/MTO. If you are already the correspondent, then that mark-up is also yours.</li>
<li>Depending on how the deal is structured, the license holder can provide you with their standard correspondents or you are more than welcome to bring one in. If you bring one in, they will signup directly with the license holder as a correspondent payout agent. You will still be protected through your ISO agent.</li>
<li>You would be required to complete the co-branding and setup and do trial/test transactions.</li>
<li>If you try to disturb the status quo, chances are the principal license holder will seek approval or clarification from various State DFIs. So keeping it simple and trying not to be aggressive in working out the best bang for your buck will ensure you will have a system that is live, rather than a pipe-dream.</li>
<li>Once everything is in place, and based on the guidelines for marketing (to which you have to adhere), you can go live.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are in luck. If you run your own calling card business, you can easily use that to transfer the value from the calling card minutes to remittances. All whilst still being legal. You would  <em>still</em> need to work with a licensed money transmitter. Having a calling card business is not a handicap but an advantage as you essentially leverage the power of your distribution network to extend the space.</p>

<p>PreCash does  <em>not</em> rent license. They work with companies they believe will add value to their existing business (i.e. increase sales) and then partner up with them by making them an Authorized Delegate.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-does-precash-charge">How Much Does Precash Charge?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-much-does-precash-charge">#</a></h3>
<p>PreCash&rsquo;s prices are, needless to say, negotiable. They don&rsquo;t just provide pricing to anyone, lest they be tagged by the state regulators as renting their licenses.</p>
<p>The supposed pricing is as follows:</p>
<p>Money Transmission Processing Pricing<br>
0-100,000, each transaction will be 25 cents<br>
100,001-200,000, each transaction will be 20 cents<br>
200,001 &amp; above, each transaction will be 15 cents.</p>
<p>So their minimum revenue guarantee that they would like is $15,000 monthly. This equates to about 60,000 transactions per month.</p>
<p>One time implementation fee varies, between US$ 50,000 to US$ 25,000 - more so on the 25k side.</p>
<p>They expect you to sign a tight 3 year contract.</p>

<p>No one is stopping you. As explained on how I perceive a company <a href="/access-to-us-money-transfer-market/">should start out with here</a>, you can opt for the solution you feel best works for you. PreCash is a great company to work with. Just expensive. As of March 2015, they are not really onboarding any new Authorized Delegates per se.</p>

<li>Credit-Debit Transfers</li>
<li>Chargeback Charges</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of the different types of MTOs are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enterprise</strong> : Multi-Country Corridors in one go and processing capability of US$ 1 Billion or more (Ex: Vimplecom, Telenor, Vodaphone, Oxigen, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Large</strong> : Single/Multi-Country Corridor Eg: Large Banks, Axis, BDO, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Medium</strong> : Thamel Remit</li>

<h4 id="per-transaction-charges">Per Transaction Charges<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#per-transaction-charges">#</a></h4>
<p>The proposed charges on a per transaction basis are:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.50% of the total value of the transaction</li>
<li>$1.99 per transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Integration Fees outside the scope would be capped on US$ 2,500. One-time setup fees for small time players is capped at US$ 1,000.</p>
<p>As cited above, this is a real-life example, however it does not imply as finalized commercials.</p>

<p>To start out with, eCheck (or Electronic ACH), is the preferred payment method of choice. Some license holders have additional payment instruments like POS/Barcode sales, Phone Calling Cards and some even offer Debit &amp; Credit Card transactions.</p>
<p>Most providers that I work with, do NOT offer Debit &amp; Credit card processing to first time users. They would like them to build their business over the course of 6 months to 1 year before offering Debit/Credit card processing.</p>

<p>Because the principal license holder will  <em>only</em> work with licensed MTOs and/or Banks, chances are you would already have a pretty thorough AML/KYC compliance program in play. If you do not, then this would raise some serious eyebrows and is a potential red-flag.</p>

<p>Yes. There is no compromise on the AML/KYC aspects. Every Principal License Holder implements a very comprehensive AML/KYC compliance program. It is expected that Correspondents will meet and/or exceed the laid out guidelines. Likewise, the Principal License Holder will also be adhering to the same.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-ach-fees-so-high">Why Is the ACH Fees So High?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-is-the-ach-fees-so-high">#</a></h3>
<p>Getting ACH (Pull) is essentially underwriting, where a bank has to agree to work with a money transmitter company (license holder) for purposes of doing direct debit. Because of the prolonged risk associated with an ACH pull (180 days), ACH providers are reluctant to work with money transfer companies. Hence, the higher ACH fees.</p>
<h3 id="besides-the-ach-and-mt-fees-are-there-any-other-fees-that-we-are-looking-at-transactional-monthly-or-otherwise">Besides the ACH and MT fees, are there any other fees that we are looking at?

<p>All the charges are on the commercial section above. If nothing new or more is added, those are the only charges one is expected to pay. Nothing other than that. Bank charges for pushing money to your Nostro account would apply, but they would be nominal, depending on what type of a push you take.

<p><em>For example:</em></p>
<p><em>0 - 10,000 .25 cents</em></p>
<p><em>100,001 - 200,000 .20 cents</em></p>
<p><em>200,001 $ above .5 cents</em></p>
<p>ACH is indeed very low. You can traditionally get ACH services for 10-25 cents. But these are Push services. The minute you cite the following, you will be hard-pressed to find an ACH provider:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are a money transfer company and have a money transmitter license.</li>
<li>The ACH needs to be pulled from the User’s Account (not push)</li>
<li>The ACH transaction is part of a international transfer / transaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do this exercise and then you will find, almost no one is willing to work with you.</p>
<p>Whilst everyone wants to get a better rate, you have to really put yourselves in the license holder’s shoes. They take all the risk, they provide licenses which cost in excess of US$ 600,000 to maintain, they pay surety bonding in excess of US$ 10 Million per year, they are legally responsible for any or all bad transactions that go through you. They find an ACH under writer, they find, all the solution pieces and put them together. Above all, they are willing to work with you. Not to be blunt, but this is what it is.</p>
<p>You would be very hard-pressed to find better rates for someone to work with you. IF you do find someone to even work with you that is.</p>

<p>Mostly No.</p>
<p>My job here is intro. You get the intro, you are then responsible for negotiating an agreement and signing it. Unless you are on a blacklist somewhere, or unless you are trading with a country that is barred from the US perspective, the license holder will work with you. In the event you cannot work with the License holder because you don’t agree to price, etc. then that would be your own calling. I charge for an introduction and that is where my work starts and ends. I’ve never had a case where a party that was introduced was not able to work.</p>

<p>The reserve amount is to cover any returns or chargebacks, etc. that your customers might initiate. This usually is negotiable.

It is nothing rigid, but just something to cover in case of a chargeback on the US side.</p>

<p>A CAMS (Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist) certification helps. If you don’t have that, you WILL have to show some course you and your team have taken in understanding AML, etc. There are quite a few providers who provide an online course, you can take the test online and pass, all within a span of 1 day. But you will need to demonstrate that you and your team have been trained in some capacity in anti-money laundering.</p>

<p>That depends which licensed money transmitter is willing to work with you. Some have all 50 States, some 1 State. Some 15 States. It all depends.</p>

<p>Possibly. You would need to discuss this with the Principal License Holder.</p>

<p>No. I don&rsquo;t work that way.</p>

<p>Yes. Pretty much. As long as you understand the caveats of your limitations and also that you do no deviate from the information that was shared, the sign-up is pretty much guaranteed.</p>

<p>No. This is the risk you take. I introduce you to a bona fide license holder, who has seen exactly what you offer, and you are pretty confident on what they offer and what limitations are at play.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-marketing-guidelines-that-you-talked-about-can-you-cite-an-example">What Are the Marketing Guidelines That You Talked About? Can You Cite an Example?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-are-the-marketing-guidelines-that-you-talked-about-can-you-cite-an-example">#</a></h3>
<p>Here is a sample guidelines pasted below:</p>
<h4 id="marketing--advertising-guidelines">Marketing &amp; Advertising Guidelines<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#marketing--advertising-guidelines">#</a></h4>
<h5 id="purpose">Purpose<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#purpose">#</a></h5>
<p>The purpose of this document is to set and parameterize the advertising and marketing guidelines for correspondents.</p>
<p>Legally speaking, if you are a non-US entity, and do <em>not</em> hold <em>authorized delegate</em> status or do not hold <em>money transmitter licenses</em> you <em>cannot</em> market directly or solicit directly customers from the US.</p>
<p>However, because you have a correspondent tie-up with a licensed money transmitter, the Principal License Holder (PLH) can market on <em>your behalf</em>.</p>
<p>This document will tell you some of the Do’s and Don’ts of the business.</p>
<h5 id="approval">Approval<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#approval">#</a></h5>
<p>All marketing &amp;/or sales efforts <em>must</em> be approved in writing prior to going live by the Principal License Holder.</p>
<h5 id="cobranding">Cobranding<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cobranding">#</a></h5>
<p>All marketing material should be co-branded so as to look 70% or more with the branding of the Principal License Holder. This means the predominant banding and logo usage, etc. should be that of the Principal License Holder.</p>
<h5 id="google-adwords-or-other-online-text-advertising">Google Adwords or Other Online Text Advertising<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#google-adwords-or-other-online-text-advertising">#</a></h5>
<p>All Google Adwords campaigns and/or other forms of online text advertising, would be run under a separate account by the Principal License Holder. Prior approval must be gained from the PLH before your ads would go live. You would <em>not</em> be allowed to run your own independent campaigns.</p>
<p>The campaign cost would be as-per-actuals, i.e. there is no markup and/or any other charges that are levied in the marketing.</p>
<p>You would be required to pre-fund an account with the PLH for your advertising campaign. There is no mandatory requirement for you to engage in Google Adwords or other online text advertising campaigns. This is purely optional.</p>
<h5 id="banner-advertising">Banner Advertising<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#banner-advertising">#</a></h5>
<p>As a correspondent, you can engage in banner advertising, which again must be approved by the PLH. If the ads are being serviced directly or via a lesser known advertising platform/network, then you may do so directly, however, you would agree to adhere to the advertising and sales guidelines at all times. If the campaign is being run of Google’s network, then again, the prefunding option would come into play.</p>
<h5 id="direct-marketing">Direct Marketing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#direct-marketing">#</a></h5>
<p>You can direct market to clients, but it must be structured as such that it is either a referral (to the URL provided to you by the PHL) or to refer to a website that you own, which in turn does a redirect to the URL provided by PHL.</p>
<h5 id="unsolicited--cold-calling">Unsolicited / Cold-Calling<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#unsolicited--cold-calling">#</a></h5>
<p>You can run your own cold-calling campaign, provided you adhere to the Do-Not-Call list and maintain extensive (read: detailed) records of the numbers called, date/time of the call, agent name, etc. If you provide recording of the calls, they would be beneficial should a claim come up. Under <em>no circumstances</em> are you to by-pass the do-not-call list that is prevalent in the US or market to consumers who are either on the list or have explicitly told you not to call them.</p>
<h5 id="referral-traffic">Referral Traffic<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#referral-traffic">#</a></h5>
<p>You can engage in referral traffic, provided you at all point in time, make the user aware that they are being re-directed to PHL’s authorized website, and that you are not providing any sort of indicative advertising as such that the service is 100% yours. The name of PHL has to be mentioned.</p>
<h5 id="domain-placement">Domain Placement<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#domain-placement">#</a></h5>
<p>Depending on the PLH that would agree to work with you, the branding can vary, you have two ways of marketing it:</p>
<p>(a). The first case is you get a domain something like <a href="http://www.SendMoneyToIndia.com">www.SendMoneyToIndia.com</a> this is owned by you. You market this domain in your community.</p>
<p>When a person is ready to make a remittance, they would be transported (redirected) to say <a href="http://www.MoneyTransferCompany.com/SendMoneyToIndia">www.MoneyTransferCompany.com/SendMoneyToIndia</a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.MoneyTransferCompany.com">www.MoneyTransferCompany.com</a> domain is owned by the PLH that would be willing to work with you. Here, under a co-branded scheme, you will have the branding of the PLH in America AND the MTO in India who will tie-up directly with the PLH in the US.</p>
<p>(b). The second option is to market, <a href="http://www.MoneyTransferCompany.com/SendMoneyToIndia">www.MoneyTransferCompany.com/SendMoneyToIndia</a> directly.</p>
<p>Same conditions as above apply.</p>
<h5 id="domain-exclusivity-or-vanity-urls">Domain Exclusivity &amp;/or Vanity URLs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#domain-exclusivity-or-vanity-urls">#</a></h5>
<p>The Principal License Holder has to maintain dominance of their domain name at <em>all</em> times. This is the <em>only</em> method by which you as a correspondent can have access to the US market.</p>
<p>Depending on how the PLH has setup, the <a href="http://www.plh_domain.com/countrynames">www.plh_domain.com/countrynames</a> might <em>not</em> be available, and you would most likely have to settle with <a href="http://www.plh_domain.com/yourbrandname">www.plh_domain.com/yourbrandname</a>.</p>
<p>In some instances, the PLH may allow you to have a sub-domain policy, i.e. yourbrandname.plh_domain.com and the PLH may opt to keep the countryname.plh_domain.com to themselves.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-sign-an-agreement-with-the-principal-license-holder">How Long Does It Take to Sign an Agreement with the Principal License Holder?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-long-does-it-take-to-sign-an-agreement-with-the-principal-license-holder">#</a></h3>
<p>Between 2-3 weeks to sign. Between 1-6 weeks to go live, depending on the integration and readiness of both parties.</p>
<h3 id="what-other-restrictions-might-be-placed-on-us-if-we-work-as-an-isocorrespondent">What Other Restrictions Might Be Placed on Us if We Work as an Iso/Correspondent?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-other-restrictions-might-be-placed-on-us-if-we-work-as-an-isocorrespondent">#</a></h3>
<p>The restrictions (if any) are defined and notified to you by the Principal License Holder. Not I.</p>
