## Money Transmitter License

### **US Remittance & Payments Solution: The Problem**

The US Remittance market is one of the largest in the world. 2014 figures show US (outgoing) remittances were **US$ 130.851 Billion** (Source: [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.TRF.PWKR.CD.DT))

An interactive view of Remittances around the World, especially the US can be seen here: <https://faisalkhan.com/remittances>

Banks, Money Transfer Operators and Commercial Companies outside the US are not allowed to solicit clients from the US without being registered with [FinCEN](https://faisalkhan.com/knowledge-hub/resources-and-references/financial-crimes-enforcement-network-fincen/) and having Money Transmitter Licenses for each state in which they do business.

In order to obtain Money Transmitter License coverage, there are two avenues of approach:

  * Obtain your own individual money transmitter licenses
  * Become an Authorized Delegate of an existing money transmitter license holder.

Obtaining your own money transmitter licenses is a very long and tedious process. It takes approximately 2 years to obtain them for all 50 US States + 3 territories (Guam, US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico).

Companies outside the US or having a majority of their principal business outside the US are subject to even more scrutiny when it comes to applying for MT licenses.

### **US Remittance & Payments Solution: The Alternative**

Unbeknownst to many, a viable alternative to Money Transmitter Licenses is getting an FBO (For Benefit Of) agent relationship / account from a licensed Nationwide chartered US Bank.

US State & National Banks are exempt from obtaining money transmitter licenses for each State.

By having a relationship with a US Bank for an FBO account, you are essentially provided MTL coverage and can now solicit clients from the US, legally, under your own brand name / company name.

However, finding a bank to work with you is the hard part.

**To be 100% clear, what is being offered below is a relationship to an existing service provider that has an Agent Relationship with a Bank**. With this, you can launch your own brand but you are tied to the payment service provider (who has the agent relationship with the bank).

Direct agent relationship is not being offered.

### **US Remittance & Payments Solution: The Banking Issue**

Because of Operation Choke Point it is extremely difficult to find banks to work with, if you are a money transmitter company.

Banks throughout the US and the world are de-risking themselves from the money transfer business.

You’d be hard pressed to find a bank willing to open an MSB account for you, let alone provide you FBO status.
