Nearly all the States have a surety bond requirement. It is important to note, most states will take bonding only from the list of approved surety bonding companies. Let us also highlight something that people don’t talk about: the surety bonding companies is a cartel. If you do too much shopping and turn it into a beauty contest, they will find out, discuss amongst themselves and then refuse to give you bonding. Even if you had a the cash and wanted to give the State(s) bonding in Cash - you cannot. Nearly all of them will force you to go back to these bonding companies.

Non-traditional MSBs such as Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency, et. al will have to pay x2 -to- x4 the premium versus the traditional MSBs. These bonding companies are nothing short of vultures. Be very cognizant of that.

Each state also has a minimum and maximum amount for the bonds. The maximum in most cases is US$ 2 Million (that’s the cap), the minimum varies from state to state. The amount applicable to you, is dependent on many factors, which the state examiner’s office will determine, based on your application.

  * What is the financial condition (at present) of the applicant?

  * What is your net worth?

  * How much business did the company do in the previous year (if at all)?
  * What is the projected volume/value of the business for the upcoming year?

In most cases you will discover it is not the cost per se that is an issue as most businesses who want to venture into the money transmission space will raise the adequate capital required to apply for money transmitter licenses. The issue is the time. 

Applying for licenses can take a considerable time-frame before you have all the necessary licenses. Small states come within the 3-6 months period. States like Florida, Massachusetts, Illinois, New Jersey, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, etc. can take between 6-9 months, and then there are the big three states: New York, California and Texas. The Big 3 as they are affectionately called. Expect NY, CA and TX to take between 12 and 24 months.
