  <div class="post-content"><p>The landscape of <strong>US Cryptocurrency Regulations</strong> in 2025 is a complex and evolving framework, combining federal and state-level rules. Each of the 50 states, Washington D.C., and U.S. territories—such as Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands—has its own set of laws governing <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/knowledge-center/payments-wiki/m/money-services-business-msb/">money services businesses (MSBs)</a>, virtual currencies, and crypto assets. While compliance requirements vary, many states mandate a <strong><a href="https://faisalkhan.com/solutions/licensing/money-transmitter-license-mtl/">money transmitter license (MTL)</a></strong> to operate with <a href="https://faisalkhan.com/knowledge-center/payments-wiki/c/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<p>At the federal level, MSBs and virtual currency service providers must adhere to regulations enforced by agencies like the <strong>Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (<a href="https://fincen.gov/">FinCEN</a>)</strong> and the <strong>Treasury Department&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)</strong>. These include registering with FinCEN and complying with <strong>anti-money laundering (AML)</strong> and <strong>know-your-customer (KYC)</strong> requirements.</p>
<p>Below, we’ve compiled a detailed, state-by-state table outlining licensing requirements for cryptocurrency businesses under <strong>US Cryptocurrency Regulations</strong>. This resource is continuously updated to reflect the latest developments in this dynamic regulatory environment. While some states have clear guidelines, others are still crafting specific rules, and federal oversight remains a work in progress as agencies clarify how existing laws apply to virtual currencies.</p>

Minnesota’s Commerce Dept. enforces licensing through multi-state compacts.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://mn.gov/commerce/">Minnesota Department of Commerce (Financial Institutions Division)</a>| Minn.

Crypto businesses have typically licensed under existing money transmitter statutes. NV FID coordinates with other states for multi-state oversight.<br>
<strong>New Hampshire</strong>|  No – Under HB 436 (2017), New Hampshire exempted virtual currency businesses from its money transmitter laws. No license is required for crypto exchanges, brokers, or ATM operators purely dealing in crypto.| N/A (Crypto exempt from money transmitter requirements)| <a href="http://www.nh.gov/banking/">New Hampshire Banking Department</a>| N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 399-G:3, VII <a href="https://www.nh.gov/banking/">NH Banking Dept.</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license needed.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): No license – fully exempt if only dealing in crypto.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: No license – NH does not treat crypto as money.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallets: No NH license required.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Also exempt under the same statute (unless dealing with something else regulated by NH).| 2017: NH passed HB 436, removing crypto from the definition of money transmission. Many crypto businesses operate in NH without a state license. NH remains one of the most permissive states.<br>
<strong>New Jersey</strong>|  Yes – New Jersey does not have a dedicated “BitLicense,” but crypto businesses handling fiat fall under the state’s existing Money Transmitters Act. Proposed bills to create a digital asset license remain pending.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/dobi/">New Jersey Department of Banking &amp; Insurance (DOBI)</a>| N.J. Stat. Ann. § 17:15C-1 et seq. <a href="https://www.state.nj.us/dobi/index.html">NJ DOBI</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for personal use.</p>

<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes – NJ has enforced actions against unlicensed ATM operators.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallets: Yes – fiat-handling exchanges must be licensed.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Probably yes – until a specific bill passes, stablecoins are treated like money transmission.| Multiple attempts to pass a “Digital Asset and Blockchain Technology Act” have stalled. Meanwhile, NJ applies existing MSB law. The state is active in multi-state enforcement (e.g. actions against unlicensed ATMs, crypto lenders).<br>

Despite not naming crypto, the Financial Institutions Division has required exchanges, brokers, and ATM operators to get licensed.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.rld.state.nm.us/">New Mexico Financial Institutions Division (FID)</a>| N.M. Stat. Ann. § 58-32-102(P); § 58-32-103 <a href="https://www.rld.nm.gov/financial-institutions/">NM FID</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for personal use.</p>

<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallets: Yes – if providing fiat on/off ramps, must be licensed.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes – no explicit exemption; stablecoin issuance is money transmission.| 2016: NM forced some crypto companies (e.g. ShapeShift) to exit due to licensing demands.</p>
<p>2019: A bill to exempt “cryptocurrency” from NM’s MSB law failed. NM remains strict: any crypto-fiat activity = money transmission, requiring a state license.<br>
<strong>New York</strong>|  Yes – New York has the BitLicense regime (23 NYCRR Part 200). Any “virtual currency business activity” with NY residents requires either a BitLicense or a limited-purpose trust charter from NYDFS.| “BitLicense” (Virtual Currency Business License)| <a href="http://www.dfs.ny.gov/">New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)</a>| 23 NYCRR Part 200 <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/apps_and_licensing/virtual_currency_businesses">NYDFS “BitLicense” Info</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: Not for personal use.</p>

<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallets: Yes – must be licensed; includes ongoing supervision and capital requirements.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes – must comply with NYDFS stablecoin reserve and redemption standards.| 2015: NY introduced the first U.S. crypto-specific license. Some companies left NY due to stringent requirements. Over time, many major exchanges and stablecoin issuers (like Paxos, Circle) obtained BitLicenses or trust charters. NYDFS actively supervises compliance, including audits and approval of coins listed by licensees.<br>
<strong>North Carolina</strong>|  Yes – North Carolina updated its Money Transmitters Act in 2016 to explicitly include virtual currency in “monetary value.” Crypto exchanges, brokers, and ATM operators must be licensed, although certain administrative/issuance roles are exempt.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.nccob.gov/public/">North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks (NCCOB)</a>| N.C. Gen. Stat. § 53-208.42(13); § 53-208.46 <a href="https://www.nccob.gov/">NC Banks</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for individuals paying with crypto.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): Yes – if buying/selling crypto for customers.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes – considered money transmission.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallets: Yes – typically must hold like-kind reserves for customer obligations.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Possibly exempt if they’re only “administrators,” but typically require a license if also transmitting.| 2016: NC passed legislation explicitly referencing virtual currency, partly modeled on the Uniform Act. Exemptions exist for merchants accepting crypto. The state requires 1:1 cryptocurrency reserves for any obligations to customers, similar to Connecticut’s approach. NC remains considered a “regulated but crypto-friendly” state.<br>
<strong>North Dakota</strong>|  Yes – North Dakota has no specific crypto exemption, so any entity transmitting funds (fiat or otherwise) for customers is subject to ND’s Money Transmitters Act. The state interprets this to include crypto-fiat activity.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.nd.gov/dfi/">North Dakota Department of Financial Institutions</a>| N.D. Cent. Code § 13-09-01 et seq. <a href="https://www.nd.gov/dfi/">ND DFI</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for personal use.</p>

<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes – ND treats them as money transmission.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallets: Yes – if handling fiat or customer funds.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes – no special exemption; stablecoin issuance is money transmission.| North Dakota quietly applies standard MSB law to crypto. The state is part of multi-state supervisory compacts, requiring large crypto exchanges to obtain ND licenses and undergo joint examinations. No dedicated crypto legislation has been passed, so the default framework remains.<br>
<strong>Ohio</strong>|  Yes – Ohio’s Money Transmitter Act applies to businesses transmitting “money,” which regulators interpret to include fiat aspects of crypto transactions. Crypto-only transfers (with no fiat handling) are generally not covered, but most major exchanges handle fiat and obtain an Ohio license.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.com.state.oh.us/">Ohio Division of Financial Institutions (Dept. of Commerce)</a>| Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 1315.01 et seq.<a href="https://apps.com.ohio.gov/safe/">Ohio DFI</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for private, one-off crypto trades.</p>

<p>Ohio has enforced licensing for crypto firms through multi-state actions. Major exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, etc.) hold an Ohio MTL.<br>
<strong>Oklahoma</strong>|  Yes – Oklahoma’s Money Transmitter Act requires a license for “receiving money or monetary value” for transmission. Although it does not explicitly mention crypto, regulators apply it to crypto-fiat transactions.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.ok.gov/banking/">Oklahoma State Banking Department</a>| Okla. Stat. tit. 6, § 1512; tit. 6, § 2101 et seq. <a href="https://banking.ok.gov/">OK Banking Dept.</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for personal use.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): Yes—facilitating fiat-to-crypto or crypto-to-fiat for others requires a license.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes—two-way ATMs are deemed money transmission.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Yes—custodial or fiat-based exchanges must be licensed.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes—no separate exemption, so stablecoins fall under money transmission.| Oklahoma has not adopted special crypto legislation but has quietly required crypto businesses to comply with MSB rules. The state is part of multi-state regulatory efforts; major exchanges have an OK license. No official carve-outs or exemptions for crypto, meaning standard money transmitter provisions apply.<br>
<strong>Oregon</strong>|  Yes – Oregon’s Money Transmitters Act defines “money” broadly enough to include digital representations of value. Regulators consider crypto-fiat businesses to be money transmitters, requiring a license.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.cbs.state.or.us/external/dfcs/">Oregon Division of Financial Regulation (DFR)</a>| Or. Rev. Stat. § 717.200(9); § 717.205 <a href="https://dfr.oregon.gov/Pages/index.aspx">Oregon DFR</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for purely private transactions.</p>

<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes—no exemption; issuing or redeeming stablecoins for fiat is money transmission.| 2019: Oregon clarified restrictions on state agencies and political donations in crypto but continued applying its MSB laws to crypto-fiat operations.Oregon participates in multi-state exams of major exchanges, requiring compliance with net worth, bonding, and permissible investment rules.<br>
<strong>Pennsylvania</strong>|  No – In 2019, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities issued guidance stating that virtual currency is not “money” under the PA Money Transmission Business Licensing Law. Therefore, businesses dealing only in crypto (exchanges, ATMs) do not need a state money transmitter license.| N/A (Crypto not regulated as “money”)| <a href="http://www.dobs.pa.gov/">Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (DoBS)</a>| PA DoBS Guidance (Jan 2019) <a href="https://www.dobs.pa.gov/">PA DoBS</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license required.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): No license under PA law if it’s strictly crypto transactions.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: No—exchanging cash for crypto via an ATM is considered a sale of goods (crypto), not money transmission, per 2019 guidance.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Not regulated as money transmitters if dealing only in crypto.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Also not covered, since stablecoins are not “money” under PA law.| Jan 2019: PA DoBS interpretive memo concluded that “virtual currency” does not meet the definition of “money” under the Money Transmission Business Licensing Law. This stance is among the most crypto-friendly. Pennsylvania enforces federal rules but does not require state MTL for crypto activities.<br>
<strong>Rhode Island</strong>|  Yes – In 2020, Rhode Island revised its Money Transmitters Act to explicitly include virtual currency business. Businesses maintaining control of virtual currency (custody or exchange) on behalf of others must obtain a Currency Transmitter License.| Currency Transmitter License (includes crypto)| <a href="http://www.dbr.state.ri.us/">Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation (Banking Division)</a>| R.I. Gen. Laws § 19-14-1(4)(ii); § 19-14-2 <a href="https://dbr.ri.gov/divisions/banking">RI DBR</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for one’s personal use.</p>

<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Yes—custodial or exchange services must license and maintain 1:1 reserves of each crypto type owed to customers.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes—treated as a form of virtual currency business, unless exempt.| 2020: Rhode Island adopted portions of the Uniform Virtual Currency Businesses Act, making “currency transmission” law explicitly cover crypto. Licensees must maintain like-kind reserves (no fractional reserves) and follow cybersecurity and consumer protection rules. This made RI one of the more stringent states, similar to Connecticut, regarding 1:1 crypto reserves.<br>
<strong>South Carolina</strong>|  Partial – South Carolina’s Money Transmitters Act does not explicitly cover purely crypto transactions (the Attorney General’s office opined that virtual currency alone is not “money”), but fiat-related transmission (e.g., holding or transferring USD for crypto trades) does require a state money transmitter license.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.sc.gov/">South Carolina Attorney General (Money Services Division)</a>| S.C. Code Ann. § 35-11-110(9); § 35-11-210 <a href="https://www.scag.gov/">SC AG Guidance</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license if it’s purely person-to-person crypto, no fiat involvement.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): If the business holds or transmits fiat for customers, it must be licensed.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: If the ATM only dispenses the owner’s crypto for cash (no third-party custody), it might not need a license. However, many operators do license to avoid enforcement risk.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallets: If they handle customer fiat, license is required.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Typically yes if receiving and sending USD; purely crypto issuance might not be covered.| 2019: SC AG’s Money Services Division clarified crypto alone is not “money,” but the fiat leg is subject to licensure.</p>
<p>2023–2024: SC is moving toward adopting the Uniform Money Transmission Modernization Act, which may explicitly include virtual currency. Until that takes effect, SC remains in a partial-regulation stance.<br>
<strong>South Dakota</strong>|  Yes – South Dakota treats virtual currency as “monetary value” for money transmission. Its Division of Banking has required exchanges, ATMs, and other crypto-fiat businesses to be licensed under the SD Money Transmitter laws.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://dlr.sd.gov/banking/">South Dakota Division of Banking</a>| S.D. Codified Laws § 51A-17-1(6) <a href="https://dlr.sd.gov/banking/">SD Division of Banking</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for private use.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): Yes – if handling fiat or customer funds for crypto trades.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes – two-way ATMs exchanging cash for crypto are considered money transmitters.</p>

<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes – stablecoin issuance/redemption is treated as transmitting monetary value.| 2019: SD’s Division of Banking published guidance that virtual currencies are “monetary value.”</p>
<p>2023: South Dakota adopted parts of the Model Money Transmission Modernization Act, imposing 1:1 crypto reserve requirements on licensees. The state has consistently enforced MSB licensing for crypto-fiat business.<br>
<strong>Tennessee</strong>|  Yes – Tennessee applies its Money Transmitter Act to the exchange or transmission of cryptocurrency when fiat is involved (receiving money for transmission). Purely crypto-to-crypto might not trigger licensure, but in practice, any business handling fiat for customers is required to get a TN money transmitter license.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.tennessee.gov/tdfi/">Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions</a>| Tenn. Code Ann. § 45-7-205(6); § 45-7-207 <a href="https://www.tn.gov/tdfi.html">TN DFI</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for private, non-custodial crypto trades.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): Yes – if receiving or transmitting fiat on behalf of customers.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes – two-way ATMs taking cash to dispense crypto or vice versa are considered money transmitters.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallets: Yes – exchanges handling fiat must be licensed. Custodial wallet providers dealing with fiat also require a license.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes – if receiving USD for stablecoins, it’s money transmission.| 2018: TN recognized blockchain signatures/contracts but made no crypto-specific license. The state simply enforces existing MSB law. Ongoing: Tennessee is part of multi-state supervision; major exchanges carry TN MTL. The approach is standard: no special crypto carve-outs, but no added restrictions either.<br>
<strong>Texas</strong>|  Yes (with nuances) – Texas does not consider a direct sale of one’s own crypto to be “money transmission.” But if a business holds fiat or facilitates transfers between third parties, it must obtain a money transmitter license. Texas also explicitly includes fiat-backed stablecoins as “money” in its statutes.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.dob.texas.gov/">Texas Department of Banking</a>| Tex. Fin. Code Ann. § 151.301(b)(3) <a href="https://www.dob.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/consumer-information/sm1037.pdf">TX DOB Guidance (Memo 1037)</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license if selling from personal inventory (principal capacity), with no third-party funds.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): If acting as a broker/agent (holding customer funds or matching buyers/sellers), a license is needed.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: If they merely sell the machine owner’s crypto, no license; if they transmit funds for third parties, license is required.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallets: Generally must be licensed if they custody users’ fiat or crypto.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes – stablecoins are “money,” requiring licensing and full reserve requirements.| 2014: Texas was the first to publish official crypto guidance, distinguishing principal sales from money transmission.</p>
<p>2019: Updated supervisory memo reaffirmed the stance.</p>
<p>2023: Texas clarified stablecoins = “money,” requiring licensing and introduced proof-of-reserves requirements (HB 1666). Texas remains relatively friendly for direct sellers but regulates custodial or third-party transactions strictly.<br>
<strong>Utah</strong>|  Yes – Utah has no crypto exemption; businesses transmitting fiat or acting as custodians for crypto-fiat trades must obtain a money transmitter license. Purely crypto-to-crypto transactions might not be covered if no fiat is involved, but in practice, most crypto platforms with fiat rails do get licensed.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://dfi.utah.gov/">Utah Department of Financial Institutions</a>| Utah Code Ann. § 7-25-102(9) <a href="https://dfi.utah.gov/">Utah DFI</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for personal, crypto-only use.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): License required if handling fiat for customers.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes – if they accept or dispense cash, it’s money transmission.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Yes – exchanges handling fiat or holding user funds must be licensed.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes – receiving money for stablecoins is money transmission.| 2019: Utah created a fintech sandbox, offering limited regulatory relief but no permanent crypto exemption. Ongoing: Utah’s Money Transmitters Act remains broad, covering fiat transmissions. Crypto-only operations that never touch fiat might be outside scope, but most major exchanges have a UT license.<br>
<strong>Vermont</strong>|  Yes – Vermont requires a money transmitter license for virtual currency businesses. In 2024, the state updated its law to fully adopt Model Money Transmission Act provisions on crypto, mandating licensees maintain 1:1 like-kind reserves and additional consumer protections.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.dfr.vermont.gov/">Vermont Department of Financial Regulation (DFR)</a>| Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 8, § 2500 et seq. <a href="https://dfr.vermont.gov/">VT DFR</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: Not licensed for personal use.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): Yes – if exchanging crypto (especially for fiat) on behalf of Vermont residents.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes – ATM operators must be licensed.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Yes – they must hold an equal amount of each crypto that they owe to customers (no fractional reserves).</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes – 1:1 reserve and licensing are required if dealing with Vermont customers.| 2017: Vermont had limited references to crypto under older laws.</p>
<p>2024: Enacted a comprehensive update adopting the MTMA with strong consumer protections (like-kind reserves, no commingling). Now among the stricter states for crypto oversight.<br>
<strong>Virginia</strong>|  No (for virtual currency itself)** – Virginia’s Money Transmitter Act covers fiat transmissions only. State licenses apply to the fiat side of crypto businesses, but the license “does not cover virtual currency transmission.” Many crypto exchanges get the VA license to handle customers’ fiat transactions.| Money Transmitter License (Foreign Transmittal Agency License)| <a href="http://www.scc.virginia.gov/">Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions (State Corporation Commission)</a>| Va. Code Ann. § 6.2-1900 et seq. <a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/pages/Consumer-Services">Virginia SCC</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for personal use.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): If you hold or transmit fiat on behalf of customers, you need a VA license. The license explicitly does not cover the crypto portion.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Possibly not required if purely selling the operator’s crypto. Many operators do license to handle any fiat aspect.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Large exchanges typically hold a VA money transmitter license for the fiat side, but VA disclaimers say it “does not cover virtual currency.”</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Unclear – the fiat portion is subject to licensure, but the “virtual currency” aspect is not regulated by VA law.| 2019–2020: Exchanges like <a href="http://CEX.io">CEX.io</a>, Coinbase, etc., obtained a VA license. They must display disclaimers that it does not cover crypto transmissions. Virginia has not updated its statutes to explicitly address crypto. So, it requires licensing for fiat transmissions but does not regulate the crypto side.<br>
<strong>Washington</strong>|  Yes – Washington amended its Uniform Money Services Act in 2017 to explicitly include virtual currency as “money transmission.” It is known for strict requirements, such as annual third-party audits, high net-worth standards, and like-kind reserves.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.dfi.wa.gov/">Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI)</a>| Rev. Code Wash. (RCW) § 19.230.010(18); § 19.230.020 <a href="https://dfi.wa.gov/">WA DFI</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license if purely private.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): Yes – any business facilitating crypto trades with fiat or acting as custodian must license.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes – WA is strict; many ATM operators initially left when the 2017 amendment passed.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Yes – WA demands audits, net worth compliance, and 1:1 reserve in the same crypto.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes – stablecoins are subject to money transmission licensing and must maintain permissible investments.| 2017: WA passed SB 5031, specifically adding “virtual currency” to money transmission. Some crypto firms left WA due to rigorous compliance (similar to NY). Since</p>
<p>2018: WA has been active in multi-state enforcement, requiring annual audits and consumer disclosures. It remains one of the toughest states for crypto compliance, second only to New York in regulatory strictness.<br>
<strong>West Virginia</strong>|  Yes – West Virginia’s Money Transmitters Act includes broad definitions covering crypto-fiat exchanges, ATM operations, etc. WV has taken enforcement action against unlicensed Bitcoin ATM operators in coordination with federal agencies.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.dfi.wv.gov/">West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions</a>| W. Va. Code R. § 106-7-2; W. Va. Code § 32A-2-3 <a href="https://dfi.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx">WV DFI</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for private usage.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): Yes – if exchanging crypto for fiat as a service.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes – WV has actively prosecuted unlicensed ATM operators.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Yes – must obtain a WV money transmitter license.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes – stablecoins are treated as forms of stored value or monetary value.| 2019: WV was involved in a high-profile bust of unlicensed ATM operators. The state also tested blockchain-based voting for overseas military but kept a firm stance on requiring MSB licensing for crypto-fiat businesses. No crypto-specific carve-outs exist, so standard money transmitter law applies.<br>
<strong>Wisconsin</strong>|  Yes – In 2018, Wisconsin enacted a new Money Transmitter Act (replacing older laws). Though it doesn’t specifically name crypto, regulators apply it to crypto-fiat transmission.| Money Transmitter License| <a href="http://www.wdfi.org/">Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (DFI)</a>| Wis. Stat. § 217.02 <a href="https://www.wdfi.org/fi/lfs/license_transmitter/default.htm">WI DFI</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license for personal transactions.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): Yes – handling fiat or receiving funds for crypto trades requires a license.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: Yes – operators exchanging cash and crypto must be licensed.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Yes – custodial or fiat-based services need WI licensing.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Yes – issuance/redemption involving fiat is money transmission.| Pre-2018: WI had no explicit money transmitter law, leading to a regulatory gap.</p>
<p>2018: Adopted a new law under Subchapter II of Chapter 217, bringing crypto-fiat under MSB licensing. Wisconsin is part of multi-state supervision, requiring major exchanges to comply with MSB rules.<br>
<strong>Wyoming</strong>|  No – Wyoming exempts “virtual currency” from its Money Transmitter Act. Under 2018 legislation, crypto exchanges and businesses solely dealing with virtual currency do not need a state money transmitter license. However, Wyoming also offers Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) charters for crypto banks.| N/A (Crypto-only businesses exempt)| <a href="http://wyomingbankingdivision.wyo.gov/">Wyoming Division of Banking</a>| Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 40-22-102(a)(vi); 2018 HB 19 <a href="https://wyomingbankingdivision.wyo.gov/">WY Division of Banking</a>| Personal Buying/Selling: No license needed for crypto.</p>
<p>OTC Trading (Business): No license if purely crypto-based.</p>
<p>Bitcoin/Crypto ATMs: No license if only dealing with crypto.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchanges/Wallet Services: Exempt from MTL under state law if they do not handle fiat.</p>
<p>Stablecoin Issuers: Potentially exempt if purely crypto-based; if fiat is involved, they may choose an <a href="https://wyomingbankingdivision.wyo.gov/banks-and-trust-companies/special-purpose-depository-institutions">SPDI charter</a> or other route.| 2018: Wyoming passed multiple pro-crypto bills, exempting virtual currency from MTL. This attracted exchanges to re-enter WY.</p>
<p>2019–2021: WY introduced the <a href="https://wyomingbankingdivision.wyo.gov/banks-and-trust-companies/special-purpose-depository-institutions">SPDI bank framework</a> (Kraken Bank, Custodia) for digital assets. Wyoming has the nation’s most crypto-friendly statutory environment at the state level.</p>
